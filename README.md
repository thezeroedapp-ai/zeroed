# Zeroed — Debt Payoff & Net Worth Tracker

> **Keep this README updated.** After every dev session, update Current Status and Changelog. The README is the single source of truth for where the project stands.

The goal of Zeroed is simple: **know exactly when you'll be debt-free, and take the fastest path there.**

Most people with credit card debt make minimum payments, get hit with interest, and never see the finish line. Zeroed connects to your real bank accounts, surfaces your actual APRs and balances, and runs a month-by-month simulation showing the optimal attack order, your exact debt-free date, and how much interest you save by throwing even $100/mo extra at it.

Built as a mobile-first React PWA. Backend runs on Firebase Cloud Functions.

## Current Status

**v8.0 — Institution logos, credit card chips, investment holdings, Stocks & Bonds Plaid connect** *(2026-05-25)*

- **Institution logos:** Every account row, settings bank list, and Dashboard priority card now shows a circular logo resolved at runtime from the institution name. Covers 70+ institutions (banks, credit cards, brokerages, auto loans, mortgages). Logo.dev provides high-quality PNGs; `AvatarCircle` with brand-color fill is the fallback. Requires `VITE_LOGO_DEV_TOKEN` in `apps/web/.env.local`.
- **Credit card chips:** Credit card rows in Accounts and the Dashboard Priority Attack widget render a CSS-only miniature card chip — brand gradient, EMV chip decoration, white-filtered institution logo. No external card art dependencies.
- **Investments / Stocks & Bonds:** Plaid `Products.Investments` enabled. Holdings synced via `investmentsHoldingsGet` and stored in `investment_holdings` subcollection. Stocks & Bonds section shows two connect CTAs (Plaid or manual). Reconnect banner retitled "Connect with Plaid".
- **`GET /api/plaid/holdings`** endpoint added.

## What It Does

### Core Features

- **Dashboard** — Net worth hero (3-line chart: assets, liabilities, net worth), 4-slice allocation donut (Cash & Savings / Investments / Credit Cards / Loans), debt payoff projection, priority attack card, spending by category, AI insights, goals status, alerts
- **Plan › Strategy** — Four payoff strategies, freed-minimum rollover, lump-sum simulator, extra payment calculator, attack order with per-card payoff dates
- **Plan › Goals** — Debt-free date targets, per-card payoff goals, balance targets; required-payment calculator answers "what does it take to be free by [date]?"
- **Plan › AI Insights** — Claude-powered spending analysis, 10/month free with freemium gate
- **Accounts › Accounts** — Category-first layout: Cash & Savings, Investments, Credit Cards (with utilization bars + APR/min/due date badges), Loans & Mortgages; net worth summary strip; institution summary; inline APR/min edit
- **Accounts › Budget** — Per-category monthly spending limits with progress bars, add/remove budgets, overall summary strip
- **Accounts › Rewards** — Pick a spend category, get ranked card recommendations (TPG valuations, debt penalty for cards with balances)
- **Spending** — Transactions (filterable), 6-month trends chart, recurring subscription detection with annual cost
- **Settings** — Plaid bank connect/disconnect/sync, income profile, sinking funds

### Payoff Strategies

| Strategy | How it works | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Avalanche** | Highest APR first | Minimizing total interest (mathematically optimal) |
| **Snowball** | Lowest balance first | Motivation — quick wins build momentum |
| **Hybrid** | 60% APR + 40% balance | Balanced — good math and visible progress |
| **Cash Flow** | Highest min/balance ratio first | Freeing up monthly cash fastest |

**Firebase project:** `zeroed-3331d`  
**Production URL:** [zeroed-3331d.web.app](https://zeroed-3331d.web.app)  
**Repository:** [github.com/thezeroedapp-ai/zeroed](https://github.com/thezeroedapp-ai/zeroed)

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v22+**
- **Firebase project** — [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com); enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google) and Firestore
- **Plaid account** — free sandbox at [dashboard.plaid.com](https://dashboard.plaid.com)
- **Anthropic API key** — optional, powers AI insights
- **Firebase CLI** — `npm install -g firebase-tools`

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thezeroedapp-ai/zeroed.git
cd zeroed
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file at the project root:

```
# Firebase (server-side) — Firebase console → Project settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT={"type":"service_account","project_id":"..."}  # paste JSON as single line

# Plaid — dashboard.plaid.com → Team Settings → Keys
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_sandbox_secret
PLAID_ENV=sandbox

# AI insights (optional)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

PORT=3000
```

`apps/web/.env.local` (Firebase client config) is committed to git — no manual setup needed. Firebase client config is not secret.

Add a `VITE_LOGO_DEV_TOKEN` to `apps/web/.env.local` for institution logos:

```
# Logo.dev publishable key — safe to expose in frontend. Get from logo.dev dashboard.
VITE_LOGO_DEV_TOKEN=pk_...
```

Without this token, all institution logos fall back to colored initial avatars — the app still works.

### 3. Start local development

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Express backend on :3000
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Vite frontend on :5173 (proxies /api to :3000)
npm run dev:web
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

**UI-only mode (proxies API to production Firebase):**
```bash
npm run dev:web:remote
```

### 4. Deploy to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
npm run deploy   # builds React + deploys Hosting + Functions + Firestore rules
```

## Firestore Schema

All user data lives under `users/{uid}/`:

| Subcollection | Document ID | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `accounts` | `plaid_account_id` | name, type (`depository`/`credit`/`investment`/`loan`/`mortgage`/`brokerage`), subtype, balance_current, apr, minimum_payment, credit_limit, payment_due_date, institution_name |
| `transactions` | `plaid_transaction_id` | account_id, amount, date, name, category |

| `dashboard_config` | `default` | widgets (ordered string array) |
| `net_worth_history` | `YYYY-MM` | total_assets, total_liabilities, net_worth, recorded_at |
| `investment_holdings` | `{account_id}_{security_id}` | account_id, security_id, quantity, institution_value, name, ticker_symbol, type, institution_name |

---

## Payoff Engine

The engine (`server/services/payoffEngine.js`) runs entirely locally — no API calls.

**Core simulation:** Each month — accrue interest → pay all minimums → attack priority card with surplus. When a card pays off, its minimum **permanently joins** the attack budget (freed-minimum rollover).

**Lump-sum simulation:** Reduces a card's balance by the lump amount, then runs a normal simulation. Returns `monthsSaved` and `interestSaved` vs. baseline.

**Required-payment calculator:** Binary search (50 iterations) over the range `[0, totalDebt]` to find the minimum extra amount achieving `months ≤ targetMonths`.

## Connecting Real Banks (Plaid Sandbox)

In sandbox mode, use these fake credentials inside the Plaid Link widget:

- **Username:** `user_good`
- **Password:** `pass_good`

## Roadmap

### Done ✅
- [x] 4 payoff strategies + freed-minimum rollover + lump-sum simulator + required-payment calculator
- [x] Goals system (3 goal types)
- [x] Transaction history with category filters, trends chart, recurring detection
- [x] AI insights with freemium gate
- [x] Card recommendation engine (10 cards, 8 categories, TPG valuations, debt penalty)
- [x] Budget system with per-category progress tracking
- [x] Firebase stack (Auth + Firestore + Cloud Functions + Hosting)
- [x] All Plaid account types (depository, credit, investment, loan, mortgage, brokerage)
- [x] Net worth tracking + monthly history snapshots
- [x] Drag-and-drop dashboard with Firestore-backed widget config
- [x] Dark/light theme toggle with no-flash init
- [x] Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui complete migration
- [x] Mantine fully removed — Tailwind is sole CSS engine
- [x] Dashboard col-1 charts: 3-line net worth, 4-slice allocation donut
- [x] Accounts page: category-first layout (Cash/Investments/Credit/Loans)
- [x] Institution logos — runtime keyword match, logo.dev delivery, brand-color fallback
- [x] Credit card chip art on all credit rows and Dashboard priority card
- [x] Investment holdings sync (Plaid Investments product, `investment_holdings` subcollection)
- [x] Stocks & Bonds dual connect CTAs (Plaid + manual)

### Phase 2 — Feature Parity 📋
- [ ] Credit score monitoring (Experian or Spinwheel VantageScore)
- [ ] Manual account entry (no Plaid required — medical debt, personal loans)
- [ ] Cash flow forecasting (3–6 month projection)
- [ ] Budget AI recommendations (Claude analyzes 3-month history, suggests limits)

### Phase 3 — Differentiation 📋
- [ ] Couples/household mode
- [ ] Lump-sum split across multiple cards
- [ ] PDF/CSV export
- [ ] Subscription cancellation workflow
- [ ] Promo APR expiry date wired up from Plaid data

### Pre-Go-Live Gates 🔒
- [ ] Plaid production credentials (`PLAID_ENV=sandbox` → `production`)
- [ ] Stripe freemium gate (`is_pro` flag in Firestore, needs Stripe Checkout + webhook)
- [ ] Plaid webhooks for real-time transaction updates
