### v9.2 — Deletion & Unlinking

**Why:** The Net Worth tab had no way to remove data. Manual assets couldn't be deleted; Plaid institution connections couldn't be revoked from the ledger. Users who added the wrong asset or wanted to remove a stale bank connection had no path. Both backend DELETE endpoints already existed (`DELETE /api/manual-assets/:id` and `DELETE /api/plaid/items/:itemId` with full cascade) — this was a pure frontend wiring task.

---

**What changed:**

**`apps/web/src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx`** *(new file)*
- Full AlertDialog primitive using `import { AlertDialog as AlertDialogPrimitive } from "radix-ui"` (monolithic package, no new dependencies)
- Overlay: `bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm` — matches Dialog
- Exports: `AlertDialog`, `AlertDialogContent`, `AlertDialogHeader`, `AlertDialogFooter`, `AlertDialogTitle`, `AlertDialogDescription`, `AlertDialogAction`, `AlertDialogCancel`
- Controlled via `open` prop — no auto-close surprises during async operations

**`apps/web/src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`** *(new file)*
- Minimal DropdownMenu primitive using `import { DropdownMenu as DropdownMenuPrimitive } from "radix-ui"`
- Exports: `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, `DropdownMenuItem`, `DropdownMenuSeparator`
- `DropdownMenuContent` renders via portal with fade+zoom animation

**`apps/web/src/services/api/manualAssetService.ts`** *(new file)*
- `deleteManualAsset(assetId)` — calls `DELETE /api/manual-assets/:id` via `apiFetch`

**`apps/web/src/services/api/plaidService.ts`**
- Added `unlinkInstitution(itemId)` — calls `DELETE /api/plaid/items/:itemId`

**`apps/web/src/hooks/useWealthAggregator.ts`**
- Interface: added `removeAsset(assetId)` and `removeInstitution(plaidItemId)` to `UseWealthAggregatorReturn`
- Implementation: both are `useCallback` — await the service call, then call `load()` to re-aggregate
- Import: added `deleteManualAsset` from `manualAssetService`

**`apps/web/src/components/AssetLedger.tsx`**
- Added `onRemoveAsset?` and `onRemoveInstitution?` props to `AssetLedgerProps`
- Added `PendingDelete` discriminated union type: `{ kind: 'asset'; id; name } | { kind: 'institution'; plaidItemId; institutionName }`
- Added `pendingDelete` and `deleting` state at the `AssetLedger` level
- Added `EllipsisMenu` sub-component: `DropdownMenu` trigger with `MoreVertical` icon, `opacity-0 group-hover/row:opacity-40 hover:!opacity-100` visibility — only appears on row hover
- `EquityPairingRow` + `UnlinkedAssetRow`: ellipsis shows only when `valuationSource === 'manual_override'` — AVM assets (`api_automated`) are protected
- `LiquidAssetRow`: ellipsis shows only when `asset.plaidItemId` is present; calls `onRequestDelete` with `kind: 'institution'`
- `UnlinkedLiabilityRow`: no ellipsis (liabilities come from Plaid; removing them requires unlinking the institution at the account level)
- `AlertDialog` at `AssetLedger` root: shows title/description tailored to delete vs. unlink; red `bg-destructive text-white` confirm button; `disabled` + "Deleting…" label during in-flight; `onOpenChange` blocked while `deleting` is true

**`apps/web/src/pages/Accounts.tsx`**
- Destructured `removeAsset` and `removeInstitution` from `useWealthAggregator()`
- Passed both as `onRemoveAsset` and `onRemoveInstitution` to `<AssetLedger />`

---

**Decisions:**
- **No new backend routes** — `DELETE /api/manual-assets/:id` and `DELETE /api/plaid/items/:itemId` already existed with full cascade
- **State lives in AssetLedger, not in rows** — a single `AlertDialog` at the container level, rows just call `onRequestDelete(item)` to signal intent
- **Re-fetch over optimistic update** — after deletion, `load()` re-runs the full aggregation pipeline; this is correct because AVM assets may need to be regenerated and equity pairings recomputed
- **AVM assets uneditable** — `api_automated` assets are ephemeral (regenerated on each load from the Plaid mortgage's `property_address`). Allowing "deletion" would just cause them to reappear on next load. Instead they are silently protected
- **Unlink operates at institution level, not account level** — a single Plaid item ID covers all accounts at that institution. Showing the menu on each account but labeling it "Unlink Institution" makes the scope clear; the warning text in the AlertDialog reinforces this

---

**Next:**
- Edit manual assets in-place (pencil icon on rows, same Dialog as add flow)
- Net worth trend chart (monthly snapshots over time) in the Net Worth tab

---

### v9.1 — Add Account Modal Refactor + ManualWidget State Isolation

**Why:** Screenshots showed the "Add Manual Asset" button in the Sheet sidebar was setting `addingSection` state in the parent (`Accounts`), which caused an inline `<AssetForm />` to appear inside whichever `ManualWidget` matched the `sectionType` check. If the user clicked "Add Manual Asset" from the global header, the form would silently open inside the Stocks & Bonds widget — a state collision that was invisible until the user scrolled to find it. The Sheet UX also felt disconnected: a right-slide-in panel is correct for detail drilldowns, not for a two-choice picker.

---

**What changed:**

**`apps/web/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`:**
- `DialogOverlay` className: `bg-black/50` → `bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm`

**`apps/web/src/pages/Accounts.tsx`:**

*Imports:*
- Removed: `Sheet, SheetContent, SheetDescription, SheetHeader, SheetTitle`
- Added: `Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle` from `@/components/ui/dialog`
- Added: `ChevronLeft` from `lucide-react`

*State:*
- Removed: `addingSection: ManualAsset['asset_type'] | null` — this was the root cause of the state collision
- Added: `addModalStep: 'selection' | 'manual_form'` — internal step within the single dialog

*Functions:*
- Removed: `openAdd(type)` — the function that set `addingSection` and caused the widget-level form
- Added: `openAddModal(type?)` — sets `addForm`, switches step to `'manual_form'`, opens the dialog
- Added: `openSelectionModal()` — opens the dialog at the `'selection'` step (used by the header `+ Add Account` button)
- Added: `closeAddModal()` — closes + resets step to `'selection'`
- Updated: `saveAdd()` — now calls `closeAddModal()` on success instead of `setAddingSection(null)`

*ManualWidgetProps interface* — removed 6 props:
- `addingSection`, `addForm`, `addSaving`, `onAdd`, `onSaveAdd`, `onCancelAdd`

*ManualWidget implementation* — removed:
- `isAddingHere` computed boolean (compared `addingSection` vs `sectionType`)
- The `{isAddingHere && <AssetForm ... />}` block at the bottom of CardContent
- The `!isAddingHere` guard on the empty-state paragraph

*ManualWidget call sites* (both `stocks_bonds` and `real_estate` widgets):
- `onOpenAdd` now wires to `openAddModal` (opens the dialog at `'manual_form'` step, pre-sets type)
- Removed: `addingSection`, `addForm`, `addSaving`, `onAdd`, `onSaveAdd`, `onCancelAdd` props

*Sheet → Dialog replacement:*
```
<Sheet open={addAccountOpen} onOpenChange={setAddAccountOpen}>
  <SheetContent ...>
```
→
```
<Dialog open={addAccountOpen} onOpenChange={open => { setAddAccountOpen(open); if (!open) setAddModalStep('selection'); }}>
  <DialogContent showCloseButton={false} className="bg-card border-border shadow-xl p-0 max-w-sm w-full gap-0">
```

*Dialog — Selection view (`addModalStep === 'selection'`):*
- Two premium selection cards with `w-10 h-10 rounded-xl bg-violet-dim` icon containers
- `group` + `group-hover:text-violet-light` on card title for hover state
- "Link an Institution" → `closeAddModal(); connectBrokerageViaPlaid()`
- "Add Manual Asset" → `setAddModalStep('manual_form')` (modal stays open, content transitions)
- Custom close button in top-right (since `showCloseButton={false}`)

*Dialog — Manual Form view (`addModalStep === 'manual_form'`):*
- `← Back` button → `setAddModalStep('selection')`
- `DialogTitle` "Add Manual Asset" with a `|` divider between Back and title
- Custom close X in top-right
- Renders `<AssetForm form={addForm} ... onSave={saveAdd} onCancel={closeAddModal} />`
- On successful save: `closeAddModal()` is called, then `loadAll()` re-fetches

---

**Root cause analysis:**

The prior Sheet implementation called `openAdd(type)` which wrote to `addingSection` state. `ManualWidget` received `addingSection` as a prop and checked `addingSection === sectionType` to decide whether to show its inline form. This means:

1. The add form was rendered inside a widget card — not isolated from the dashboard
2. If the user had a different widget section open (e.g. real estate visible, stocks collapsed), the form could appear off-screen
3. The Sheet had to close before the inline form opened — two separate state transitions causing a visible flicker

The fix eliminates `addingSection` entirely. The dialog holds all add-flow state internally. Widgets no longer need to know whether they're "the active add target."

---

**Files changed:**
- MOD: `apps/web/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` — overlay backdrop blur
- MOD: `apps/web/src/pages/Accounts.tsx` — Sheet → Dialog, state-collision fix, ManualWidget cleanup

### v9.0 — Asset Aggregation System, Net Worth Tab, Smart Real Estate Valuation

**Why:** The Accounts page had manual asset entry but no way to see how assets and liabilities related to each other, no automated valuation, and no clear net worth picture beyond the Dashboard hero chart. The goal was a full asset ledger with automated valuation workflows — matching what Monarch Money and Origin show in their balance sheet / net worth views.

---

**Architecture decisions:**

**Separation of concerns — new layer stack:**

The prior implementation had Plaid account data, manual assets, and display logic all tangled in page components. Added four new layers:

- `apps/web/src/types/domain.ts` — vendor-agnostic domain types: `PhysicalAsset`, `LiquidAsset`, `Liability`, `NetWorthResult`. These are the internal contract. No Plaid-specific shapes leak into components.
- `apps/web/src/services/api/plaidService.ts` — `fetchAccounts()` returns typed `RawPlaidAccount[]`. Plaid's shape is a detail; callers work with domain types.
- `apps/web/src/services/api/valuationService.ts` — `fetchRealEstateAVM(address)` and `fetchVehicleValue(specs)`. Both return typed results; callers don't know whether it's RentCast or MarketCheck.
- `apps/web/src/engines/netWorthEngine.ts` — pure function: `aggregateNetWorth(liquid, physical, liabilities) → NetWorthResult`. No I/O, fully testable.
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useWealthAggregator.ts` — orchestrates: parallel Plaid + manual asset fetch → AVM for auto-valued mortgages → pending auto loan detection → engine call → state update. Exposed as `{ status, error, result, liquidAssets, pendingAutoLoans, linkVehicleToLoan, refresh }`.

**Why pure engine:** If we ever add forecasting, what-if scenarios, or server-side net worth calculation, the engine is already extractable — no page state mixed in.

---

**Workflow A — Zero-Touch Mortgage AVM:**

When a Plaid mortgage has `property_address` in its metadata and no manual asset is already linked, `useWealthAggregator` automatically calls `fetchRealEstateAVM(address)` → creates a `PhysicalAsset` with `valuationSource: 'api_automated'` and `id: 'avm_{mortgageId}'` → links it to the mortgage. This requires no user action. The `AssetLedger` component shows an "API: RentCast" source badge on these auto-valued assets.

Design choice: failures are soft — `Promise.allSettled` wraps all AVM calls so a 429 or network error surfaces the mortgage as an unlinked liability rather than crashing the whole aggregation.

---

**Workflow B — Smart-Friction Auto Loans:**

Unlinked auto loans (no `PhysicalAsset.linkedLiabilityId` matching their ID) populate `pendingAutoLoans` in the hook. These surface in `AssetDiscoveryBanner` — an amber banner with one VIN input per loan. User submits VIN → `fetchVehicleValue(specs)` → POST `/api/manual-assets` with `linked_loan_id` → hook `load()` re-runs → loan disappears from banner, appears in ledger as a linked equity pair.

"Smart friction": the banner is dismissible per-loan (`dismissedLoans: Set<string>` in Accounts state), and the vehicleHint from Plaid metadata (e.g. "2021 Toyota Camry") pre-fills a hint in the input so the user knows what they're valuing.

---

**Net Worth tab — AssetLedger component:**

Added `net-worth` as a 4th Accounts subtab (order: Accounts → Net Worth → Budget → Rewards). Uses `useWealthAggregator` directly in `Accounts.tsx`. The `AssetLedger` renders:

1. **Net Worth Summary Strip** — three stat boxes: Total Assets / Total Liabilities / Net Worth, with color-coded delta from prior month.
2. **Equity Pairings** — each `PhysicalAsset` with a `linkedLiabilityId` gets a paired row: asset value, liability balance, equity = asset − liability, LTV bar (liability / asset as percentage). Source badge in the corner.
3. **Owned Assets** — `PhysicalAsset` entries without a linked liability. Includes growth coefficient badge.
4. **Cash & Liquid** — `LiquidAsset` rows (depository, investment, brokerage).
5. **Unlinked Debt** — `Liability` entries with no `linkedAssetId` (e.g. credit cards, student loans). Shown with outstanding balance only — not colored red (per the color-psychology rules: debt amounts are never red unless urgent-alert threshold).

---

**Smart real estate form — three UX layers:**

The Add/Edit manual asset form detects `asset_type === 'real_estate'` and conditionally shows an address block:

1. **Address autocomplete as-you-type:** 300ms debounce calls `GET /api/valuations/address-autocomplete?q=...` → backend proxies to Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) → returns formatted `"street, city, state, zip"` strings. Dropdown with keyboard nav (↑/↓/Enter/Escape). `onMouseDown + preventDefault` on suggestion buttons prevents blur-before-click race condition.

2. **"Get Estimate" AVM button:** Fires `fetchRealEstateAVM(address)` → pre-fills `current_value` field with the RentCast estimate. User can override it. Button disabled while fetching; error shown inline if RentCast is unavailable.

3. **Auto-fill from linked mortgage:** When user selects a Plaid mortgage in the loan dropdown, if that mortgage has `property_address` in its Plaid metadata, `address` is automatically written into the form. The address then drives autocomplete + AVM on demand.

---

**Backend additions:**

- `server/routes/valuations.js` — three endpoints:
  - `GET /real-estate?address=…` → calls `valuationService.fetchRealEstateAVM(address)` (RentCast)
  - `POST /vehicle` → calls `valuationService.fetchVehicleValue(specs)` (MarketCheck, VIN or make/model/year)
  - `GET /address-autocomplete?q=…` → proxies Nominatim; formats `addressdetails` into clean strings; degrades silently on error
- `server/routes/plaid.js` — added `GET /liabilities`: returns only `credit`, `loan`, `mortgage` accounts with extended metadata fields (APR, property_address, vehicle_description). Separated from `/accounts` so the wealth aggregator can fetch liabilities efficiently without filtering the full account list client-side.
- `server/routes/manual-assets.js` — POST + PUT now accept `address` field; stored in Firestore only for `asset_type === 'real_estate'`. PUT always writes `address: null` for non-real-estate to prevent stale data when type changes.
- `server/server.js` — mounted `valuationsRoutes` at `/api/valuations`.

**Why Nominatim for autocomplete, not Google Places:** Zero cost, no API key, OpenStreetMap data is excellent for US addresses. The backend proxy avoids CORS and adds `User-Agent` (Nominatim requirement). Degrades silently if unavailable — user can still type manually.

---

**Errors encountered and fixed:**

- **`liquidAssets` inline import type cast in JSX:** Initial draft tried `import('@/types/domain').LiquidAsset[]` inside a JSX expression — invalid TypeScript. Fixed by adding `liquidAssets: LiquidAsset[]` to the hook's return type and state, exposing it directly.
- **Net Worth tab JSX placed outside container div:** When inserting the tab's JSX, the replacement target (`{/* ── Global Add Account Sheet ── */}`) was after the `px-6` container's closing `</div>`, so the new tab rendered outside its padding context. Diagnosed by reading the file at the affected range; repaired by replacing the malformed block (extra `</div>` + tab JSX + Sheet comment) with the correct nesting.
- **`startEditAsset` missing `address` field:** After adding `address` to `ManualAssetForm`, TypeScript caught that `setEditForm` in `startEditAsset` didn't include it. Fixed by adding `address: a.address || ''`.

---

**Files changed:**
- NEW: `apps/web/src/types/domain.ts`
- NEW: `apps/web/src/services/api/plaidService.ts`

- NEW: `apps/web/src/components/AssetDiscoveryBanner.tsx`
- NEW: `server/routes/valuations.js`
- NEW: `server/services/valuationService.js`
- MOD: `server/routes/plaid.js` — added `GET /liabilities`
- MOD: `server/routes/manual-assets.js` — `address` field on POST/PUT
- MOD: `server/server.js` — mount valuations router
- MOD: `apps/web/src/pages/Accounts.tsx` — Net Worth tab, AssetForm with autocomplete + AVM, useWealthAggregator integration

---

**Decisions made:**

- **`useWealthAggregator` lives in `hooks/`, not inside Accounts.tsx** — Net Worth data will eventually also feed Dashboard widgets (net worth trend chart needs asset/liability breakdown). Keeping the hook separate means Dashboard can import it without depending on the Accounts page.
- **AVM fires automatically for mortgages, not for other asset types** — Mortgages are the only case where Plaid reliably supplies a `property_address`. Vehicles don't have a reliably scraped VIN in Plaid data. The asymmetry is intentional.
- **Manual `current_value` always wins over AVM in the ledger** — If a user has a manual asset with `linked_loan_id` matching a mortgage, the AVM workflow is skipped for that mortgage. Manual data takes precedence.
- **AssetDiscoveryBanner is dismissible, not blocking** — Net worth renders even if auto loans are unlinked. The amber banner is an invitation, not a gate. Dismissed state is session-only (`useState` not persisted) — reappears on refresh to remind the user.

### v5.4 — UI Audit + Incremental Fixes + Full Redesign Plan

**Why:** User reviewed live app at zeroed-3331d.web.app, shared screenshots of all 5 pages alongside reference apps (Monarch Money, Origin, Copilot Money, Brightly). Said "I need you to take all these screenshots into account — it needs to be this clean and intuitive." Before making changes, we audited the code and identified root causes across all pages.

---

**Audit findings (root causes, not symptoms):**

**Issue 1 — Critical: `bg-background` blocked gradient on 4 of 5 pages**
All inner pages (Plan, Accounts, Spending, Settings) had `className="min-h-dvh bg-background"` on their root div. This solid opaque color sat on top of the body `background-image` gradient, making it invisible. The glass `backdrop-filter` blur on the sidebar also had nothing to blur through on those pages. Dashboard had already been fixed in v5.3; the other 4 pages were missed.

**Issue 2: Top bar used unreliable Tailwind oklch opacity modifier**
All 4 inner pages used `bg-background/85 backdrop-blur-xl` on their sticky header. The `/85` Tailwind opacity modifier on an oklch CSS variable is unreliable across browsers — it can fall back to fully opaque. The correct approach (already used on Dashboard) is the `top-bar` CSS class, which uses `color-mix(in oklch, var(--background) 88%, transparent)` — a direct CSS function that always works.

**Issue 3: Dark mode card-to-background contrast too low**
`--card: oklch(0.105 0.024 258)` vs `--background: oklch(0.065 0.015 264)` — only ~4% lightness delta. Cards were nearly indistinguishable from the page background, making everything look flat. Shadow ring at 7% white opacity was also too subtle.

**Issue 4: Typography hierarchy too weak**
All page headers used `text-[17px]` — same size as body text. No visual weight difference between "Settings" as a page title and a card paragraph. Section labels at `text-[11px] font-bold uppercase` were near-invisible against dark backgrounds.

**Issue 5: Spacing too tight on inner pages**
`px-4 pt-4` for page padding vs Dashboard's `px-5 pt-6`. Cumulative effect: every inner page felt more cramped than the Dashboard.

**Issue 6: Sidebar glass invisible on inner pages**
Glass blur requires visual content behind the blurring element. Since inner pages had solid `bg-background`, the sidebar's `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` had nothing to blur through — it appeared as a plain flat dark panel.

---

**What changed (v5.4 commit `60dfe93`):**

**`apps/web/src/index.css`:**
- Light mode: background shifted to warmer `oklch(0.96 0.006 255)`, muted-foreground darkened `0.44→0.40` for better section label contrast, card shadow includes 1px border ring for clean card definition on white backgrounds
- Dark mode: `--card` `0.105→0.140`, `--surface-2` `0.135→0.180`, `--border` `10%→14%`, card shadow ring `7%→12%`, nav-bg slightly lighter, muted-foreground slightly lighter for readability

**`apps/web/src/pages/Plan.tsx`, `Accounts.tsx`, `Spending.tsx`, `Settings.tsx` (same pattern on all 4):**
- Root div: removed `bg-background`
- Sticky header: `bg-background/85 backdrop-blur-xl` → `top-bar` class
- Page title: `text-[17px]` → `text-xl`
- Page padding: `px-4 lg:px-8 pt-4` → `px-5 lg:px-10 pt-6`
- Bottom padding: `md:pb-8` → `md:pb-10`

**`apps/web/src/pages/Settings.tsx` extra:**
- Section spacing: `space-y-6` → `space-y-8`
- Section labels: `text-[11px] font-bold` → `text-xs font-semibold` (more readable, less "shouting")
- Income card padding: `p-4` → `p-5`

---

**Why these fixes weren't enough:**

After deploying v5.4 and reviewing screenshots, user confirmed the UI still looked essentially the same. This is expected — the fixes were structural (unblocking the gradient, fixing glass) and incremental (CSS variable tweaks). They are necessary corrections but they don't change the *design*. 

The reference apps (Monarch, Origin) have a fundamentally different visual language:
- Default **light mode** with white cards on gray background (our dark mode was the primary experience)
- **48-64px** hero numbers vs our 48px (same, but surrounded by much more breathing room)
- **Section headers** at 16px semibold (our `text-[11px]` caps labels are nearly invisible)
- **24-32px** card padding throughout (we're at 16-20px)
- **Sidebar** with full-width active state pill, user profile at bottom, clear visual separation
- **Transaction rows** with merchant avatar circles, more padding, cleaner typography
- **Page titles** at 24-28px bold (we're at 20px)

The conclusion: structural code is correct. Visual design needs a full overhaul. See the **UI Redesign Backlog (v6.0)** section in the README for the complete task list.

---

**Decisions made:**

- **Do the full redesign before Phase 2 features.** Consumer fintech lives on first impressions. Adding credit score monitoring to a UI that doesn't feel premium is the wrong order of operations. The redesign is the next priority.
- **Light mode first.** All reference apps the user showed are light-mode-first. User has been using dark mode but the design intent is shifting. v6.0 should default to light and make dark the toggle.
- **No partial redesigns.** Touching one page at a time creates inconsistency. The v6.0 redesign will cover all 5 pages + sidebar + CSS tokens in one session.
- **README is the source of truth.** Full redesign TODO is documented in README `UI Redesign Backlog (v6.0)` section so it can be picked up from any machine.

---

### v5.3 — Glass UI Design System + Dark/Light Theme Toggle

**Why:** The UI was always-dark with no toggle, no elevation system, and flat opaque nav bars. User requested glass UI / material design aesthetic with consistent spacing and a dark/light toggle. Goal: look like a premium consumer fintech product, not a developer side project.

**What changed:**

**Theme system (`apps/web/src/context/ThemeContext.tsx` — new file):**
- `ThemeProvider` with `useTheme()` hook — `theme: 'dark' | 'light'` + `toggle()` function
- Reads initial theme from `localStorage.getItem('zeroed-theme')`, defaults to `'dark'`
- Applies/removes `html.dark` class via `useEffect` on theme change
- Persists to `localStorage` on every change
- `toggle()` adds `html.theme-transitioning` class before state change, removes it after 280ms — enables smooth CSS transitions only during the toggle (not during normal interactions, which avoids GPU overhead)

**No-flash init (`apps/web/index.html`):**
- Added inline `<script>` before `</head>` that reads `localStorage.getItem('zeroed-theme')` and adds `.dark` to `<html>` synchronously before React renders. Without this, dark-mode users see a white flash on load. Script is one line: `(function(){var t=localStorage.getItem('zeroed-theme')||'dark';if(t==='dark')document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');})();`

**`App.tsx`:** Wrapped `<AuthProvider>` with `<ThemeProvider>` — outermost context since theme doesn't depend on auth.

**CSS overhaul (`apps/web/src/index.css`):**

Theme structure:
- `:root` = light theme (new) — `oklch(0.97 0.007 264)` background, `oklch(1 0 0)` cards, status colors darkened for WCAG contrast on white (`--green: oklch(0.40 0.15 162)`, `--red: oklch(0.46 0.22 22)`, `--amber: oklch(0.46 0.17 82)`)
- `html.dark` = dark theme (moved from `:root`) — original dark palette unchanged
- `--violet-light` differs by theme: dark = `oklch(0.72 0.14 290)` (light lavender for dark bg), light = `oklch(0.42 0.22 290)` (deep violet for white bg — maintains WCAG AA contrast)
- `--gradient-to` CSS var for gradient text second stop — dark: `oklch(0.82 0.12 310)` (light mauve), light: `oklch(0.62 0.19 310)` (medium violet-pink). Both `.gradient-text` and `.auth-logo` now use `var(--gradient-to)` instead of hardcoded oklch

Glass utilities added:
- `.glass` — `backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%)` + `-webkit-` prefix
- `.side-nav` — glass sidebar with `var(--nav-bg)` background + `var(--shadow-nav)` side shadow. Replaces hardcoded `bg-[var(--nav-bg)]` on SideNav.
- `.bottom-nav` — glass bottom bar with `var(--nav-bg)`. Replaces hardcoded `bg-[color:oklch(0.075_0.018_262/92%)]` (dark-mode-only color).
- `.top-bar` — `color-mix(in oklch, var(--background) 88%, transparent)` + blur. Uses native CSS `color-mix()` for opacity (more reliable than Tailwind's `/85` modifier with oklch CSS vars).
- `.card-hero` — `box-shadow: var(--shadow-hero)`. In dark mode this includes a 80px oklch violet ambient glow.

Elevation shadow system:
- `--shadow-card`: soft card shadow (light: `0 1px 3px + 0 4px 16px`, dark: `0 2px 8px oklch(0 0 0 / 35%) + 1px ring`)
- `--shadow-elevated`: stronger shadow for dialogs, sheets
- `--shadow-hero`: hero card — plus violet glow in dark (`0 0 80px oklch(0.49 0.21 290 / 14%)`)
- `--shadow-nav`: directional sidebar shadow
- In `@theme inline`: `--shadow-sm: var(--shadow-card)` and `--shadow-md: var(--shadow-elevated)` — overrides Tailwind's default shadow values. Since shadcn `Card` uses `shadow-sm` by default, every card in the app automatically gets elevation-aware shadows without touching any component code.

Page background:
- `body` now has `background-image: radial-gradient(ellipse 70% 45% at 65% -10%, oklch(0.49 0.21 290 / 10%) 0%, transparent 70%)` — violet bloom in the upper-right corner. In dark mode this is a visible purple glow; in light mode it's a very subtle tint. This gives glass cards something to reveal behind them via `backdrop-filter`.

Theme transition:
```css
html.theme-transitioning *, ... {
  transition: background-color 0.22s ease, border-color 0.22s ease, color 0.22s ease, box-shadow 0.22s ease, fill 0.22s ease !important;
}
```
Applied only while toggling — not on every mouse interaction.

**SideNav.tsx rewrites:**
- Replaced `bg-[var(--nav-bg)] border-r border-border` → `side-nav border-r border-border` (CSS class)
- Added `Sun` and `Moon` imports from lucide-react
- Added `useTheme()` import
- Replaced `mt-auto` on admin NavLink with explicit `<div className="flex-1" />` spacer — cleaner than CSS auto-margin trick
- Added theme toggle button (Sun/Moon icon + label) at very bottom of sidebar, with `Tooltip` on icon-only (md) viewport
- Extracted `itemClass()` helper to deduplicate active/inactive nav link styles

**BottomNav.tsx:**
- Changed `'bg-[color:oklch(0.075_0.018_262/92%)] backdrop-blur-xl'` → `'bottom-nav'` — removes dark-mode-only hardcoded color; now theme-aware

**Dashboard.tsx:**
- Top bar: `'backdrop-blur-xl border-b border-border bg-background/85'` → `'top-bar border-b border-border'` (CSS class, avoids Tailwind oklch opacity modifier issues)
- Hero card: added `card-hero` CSS class for violet-glow shadow; changed `mb-4` → `mb-5` for breathing room; border changed from `border-border` → `border-[var(--primary)]/20` for a subtle violet tint

**Decisions:**
- **Default dark, not default light** — Zeroed's brand is dark. Light mode is a toggle for users who want it, not the primary experience.
- **`html.dark` class strategy (not `prefers-color-scheme` media query)** — user preference should override system preference. The Sun/Moon toggle lets users set their own preference regardless of OS setting.
- **`color-mix()` for top bar opacity** — Tailwind's `bg-background/85` opacity modifier is unreliable with oklch CSS custom properties in v4. `color-mix(in oklch, var(--background) 88%, transparent)` is a direct CSS solution that works in all modern browsers.
- **Shadow override via `@theme inline`** — instead of adding `.shadow-*` classes to every card, overriding `--shadow-sm` in `@theme inline` means all existing shadcn cards get elevation-aware shadows automatically. One change, global effect.
- **`backdrop-filter` only where it matters** — didn't apply glass to every card (GPU cost). Glass on: sidebar (always visible), bottom nav (always visible), top bar (sticky, always visible), hero card (main focal point). Widget cards get elevation via shadow only.
- **No `useLayoutEffect` for theme init** — the `index.html` inline script handles the initial class synchronously. `useEffect` in `ThemeContext` handles subsequent toggles. The 1-frame delay on toggle is imperceptible and avoids SSR issues.

### v5.2 — shadcn/ui + Tailwind v4 Migration

**Why:** The hand-rolled CSS design system was showing cracks — subtle alignment bugs, inconsistent card sizing, no component hierarchy, and chart widgets that looked out of place across screens. The goal was a polished consumer-fintech UI with better charts and drill-down capability. Evaluated Tremor and Nivo; chose shadcn/ui because it gives the most control (copy-paste, not a dependency to fight), pairs natively with recharts (already installed), and Tailwind v4 removes all config friction.

**What changed:**

**Infrastructure (Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui setup):**
- Added `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`, `tw-animate-css` to `apps/web/package.json`
- `apps/web/vite.config.ts`: added `tailwindcss()` plugin (first in array), added `'@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src')` alias
- `apps/web/tsconfig.app.json`: added `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` to `paths` for TypeScript resolution
- `apps/web/components.json`: shadcn config (`style: "new-york"`, `rsc: false`, `tsx: true`, CSS variables on)
- `apps/web/src/lib/utils.ts`: `cn()` helper — `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`
- `apps/web/src/index.css`: complete rewrite — `@import "tailwindcss"`, `@import "tw-animate-css"`, `@theme inline` block mapping shadcn CSS vars to Tailwind color utilities, `:root` block defining all tokens in oklch. Kept `.spinner`, `.skeleton`, `.gradient-text`, `.widget-grid`, `.pills`, auth page classes.

**shadcn/ui components installed** (`apps/web/src/components/ui/`):
`avatar`, `badge`, `button`, `card`, `chart`, `dialog`, `input`, `label`, `progress`, `scroll-area`, `select`, `separator`, `sheet`, `tabs`, `tooltip` — 15 components.

> **Windows path gotcha:** `npx shadcn@latest add` on Windows creates a literal `@/` directory at `apps/web/@/components/ui/` instead of resolving `@/` to `src/`. Fixed by: `cp -r "apps/web/@/components/ui/." "apps/web/src/components/ui/"` then `rm -rf "apps/web/@"`.

**Color system (`apps/web/src/index.css`):**
All oklch values — chosen to match the existing hex palette exactly so the visual change was upgrade, not redesign:

| Token | oklch | Hex equiv | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--background` | `oklch(0.065 0.015 264)` | `#07090f` | Page background |
| `--card` | `oklch(0.105 0.024 258)` | `#0d1424` | Card surfaces |
| `--primary` | `oklch(0.49 0.21 290)` | `#7c3aed` | Violet accent |
| `--violet-light` | `oklch(0.72 0.14 290)` | `#a78bfa` | Text on accents, active states |
| `--green` | `oklch(0.70 0.16 162)` | `#10b981` | Positive values |
| `--red` | `oklch(0.64 0.22 22)` | `#f43f5e` | Debt, expenses |
| `--amber` | `oklch(0.78 0.19 82)` | `#f59e0b` | Warnings |
| `--blue` | `oklch(0.62 0.20 264)` | `#3b82f6` | Charts |

**Navigation rewrites:**
- `SideNav.tsx`: lucide-react icons (Home, Target, CreditCard, TrendingUp, Settings, Shield), `hidden md:flex`, `w-[68px] lg:w-[220px]`, gradient "Z"/"Zeroed" logo. At md (collapsed): icon-only 40×40 squares, `Tooltip` on hover. At lg (expanded): icon + label side by side.
- `BottomNav.tsx`: `md:hidden`, lucide-react icons, Tailwind active state (`text-violet-light`).
- `SubNav.tsx`: replaced `.pills`/`.pill` CSS with Tailwind + `cn()` — `rounded-full` pills with violet active state.

**Layout fix (`Layout.tsx`):**
Critical bug: the original layout used `flex min-h-dvh` as the wrapper with `SideNav` fixed (removed from flow). `flex-1 ml-[68px]` on the content div was theoretically correct (flex free-space calculation accounts for margins) but caused content to render overlapping the sidebar in practice. Switched to a non-flex approach: `SideNav` fixed, `<main className="md:ml-[68px] lg:ml-[220px]">` as a plain block. Sidebar content is now always fully visible.

**Dashboard.tsx — complete rewrite:**
- Drill-down state: `sheet: { open: boolean; type: 'spending'|'networth'|'goal'|null; payload? }` drives a shadcn `Sheet` that slides in from the right.
- `SortableWidgetShell` updated: lucide `GripVertical` + `X` icons, shadcn `Card` as the drag wrapper.
- Three `ChartConfig` objects for recharts color/label mapping (`debtChartConfig`, `netWorthChartConfig`, `spendingChartConfig`).
- Widget changes: `debt_projection` → `ChartContainer` + `AreaChart` (height 150px); `net_worth_trend` → clickable, opens Sheet with expanded line chart + assets/liabilities breakdown; `spending_by_category` → horizontal `BarChart` with `Cell` per-bar colors, each bar clickable, opens Sheet with full category list + `Progress` bars; `goals_progress` → clickable rows open Sheet with goal details.
- Hero card redesigned: two-column top (Total Debt + Monthly Interest Cost), three-column stat strip (Minimums / Surplus / Net Worth). Removed the always-full red `Progress` bar (conveyed nothing). Subtle violet gradient background via `bg-gradient-to-br`.
- Default widget order rebalanced for better 2-column pairing: (Projection, Spending) → (Net Worth, Priority Attack) → (Goals, AI Insights) → Alerts.

**Plan.tsx — complete rewrite:**
Strategy selector: 2×2 grid of visual cards with emoji icons (🔥❄️⚖️💸), strategy name, sub-description, "best for" `Badge`. Active strategy: violet ring (`ring-1 ring-[var(--primary)]`). All other plan UI migrated to shadcn `Card`, `Input`, `Button`, `Select`, `Label`, `Progress`.

**Accounts.tsx — complete rewrite:**
Net worth strip: 3-column `Card` grid. Accounts by institution: `Card` per bank with accounts inside, `Badge` for APR/min/limit/due date. Inline edit: shadcn `Input`/`Label`/`Button`. Budget: `Progress` with `[&>div]:bg-red/green/amber` modifier. Rewards: 4-column category grid + shadcn `Card` per recommendation.

**Spending.tsx — complete rewrite:**
Transactions: `Card` list with colored icon circles (green ✅ for payments, 🛍️ for purchases). Trends: shadcn `ChartContainer` + recharts stacked `BarChart`. Recurring: annual total hero `Card` + per-item rows with `Badge` for category.

**Settings.tsx — complete rewrite:**
All shadcn `Card`/`Input`/`Label`/`Select`/`Button`. Income save: flash feedback (button turns green for 2s → "✓ Saved"). Plaid items: error banner, Reconnect/Disconnect buttons with `border-red/30 text-red hover:bg-red/10` styling.

**Login.tsx + Signup.tsx — rewrite:**
shadcn `Input`/`Label`/`Button`. Error state: inline red banner (`bg-red/10 border-red/25`) replacing `.auth-error`. Auth page layout CSS classes (`auth-logo`, `auth-card`, `auth-title`, `auth-divider`, `auth-footer`) restored to `index.css` — they were in the old CSS but omitted from the first shadcn pass.

**TypeScript fixes:**
- `Dashboard.tsx`: removed unused `ResponsiveContainer` import; typed `BarChart` `onClick` handler as `(d: any)` to avoid `activePayload` not-on-type error.
- `Settings.tsx`: removed unused `Badge` import.
- `Spending.tsx`: removed unused `Cell` and `ResponsiveContainer` imports.

**Decisions:**
- **shadcn/ui over Tremor** — Tremor would have locked chart aesthetics and constrained customization. shadcn wraps recharts directly and lets us control everything.
- **Always-dark, no toggle** — Zeroed's brand is dark. Adding a light mode now would require auditing every color decision twice with no user demand.
- **oklch everywhere** — Tailwind v4 is designed around oklch; using it throughout gives better color mixing (e.g. `primary/10` alpha modifiers work predictably in the perceptual color space).
- **`@theme inline` bridge** — Maps shadcn's CSS var names (`--background`, `--primary`, etc.) to Tailwind utility names (`bg-background`, `text-primary`). One block in `index.css` makes the whole system work without any `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Drill-down as Sheet, not modal** — Sheet slides in from the right without blocking the chart that triggered it; the user can see the chart and the detail simultaneously at wider viewports.

### v5.1 — Drag-and-Drop Dashboard + Demo Seed Data

**What changed:**

**Drag-and-drop widget reordering (`apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`):**
- Replaced the ↑/↓ button reorder system with `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` (added to `apps/web/package.json`)
- `SortableWidgetShell` component wraps each widget: uses `useSortable`, renders a `⠿` drag handle (top-left, `setActivatorNodeRef`) and a `×` remove button (top-right) — both only visible in edit mode. Handle activates drag so card content (buttons, charts, links) stays interactive.
- Sensors: `PointerSensor` (8px distance threshold) + `TouchSensor` (200ms delay, 8px tolerance) — distinguishes intentional drag from scroll on touch devices
- `DragOverlay` renders a ghost of the active widget at `transform: scale(1.02)` with violet drop shadow during drag
- `handleDragEnd` calls `arrayMove` then `persistConfig` — auto-saves debounced 600ms after every drag, add, or remove (no Save button needed)
- Widget grid: uniform `.widget-grid` CSS class — 1-col mobile, 2-col tablet/desktop (768px+), `min-height: 180px` per card. Hero card (Total Debt) is pinned above the `DndContext` — always visible, not draggable.
- "Add Widgets" section below the grid in edit mode: hidden widget IDs shown as `btn-outline btn-sm` chips to add back to the grid
- Edit button in top-bar: `.btn-primary` (violet fill) when in edit mode, `.btn-ghost` otherwise

**React hooks fix:** `draftWidgets` `useState` was declared after a `useEffect` in an earlier draft — violates React rules of hooks. Fixed by moving all state declarations to the top of the component before all `useEffect` calls.

**CSS additions (`apps/web/src/index.css`):**
- `.widget-grid`: `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 12px;`
- `.widget-grid .card { min-height: 180px; overflow: hidden; }`
- `.widget-grid-full { grid-column: 1/-1; }`
- `@media (min-width: 768px)`: `.widget-grid { grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 12px; }`

**Comprehensive demo seed data (`scripts/seed-demo.js` — complete rewrite):**

UID: `eUD7KA6dMgbx6YcL2u6Q3jy43gn2` (Venkat / venkatrbade@gmail.com)

10 accounts:
- Cash: Chase Checking ($3,240), Joint Checking ($1,887), Marcus Savings ($18,400)
- Assets: Fidelity 401k ($87,650)
- Loans: Chase Mortgage ($312,450/6.75%), Toyota Camry ($18,750/5.9%), Honda CR-V ($9,200/4.5%)
- Credit cards: Citi ($12,450/19.99%/$249 min), Chase Sapphire ($7,820/22.49%/$156 min), Amex Gold ($4,340/29.99%/$87 min)

201 transactions across 6 months (Dec 2025 – May 2026):
- Per month: 8 recurring subs (Netflix $22.99, Spotify $11.99, Hulu $17.99, AT&T $165, Comcast $79.99, PG&E, Apple One $29.95, Equinox $185), 3x groceries ($85–$165), 5x dining ($18–$85), 3x gas ($45–$72), 2-3x shopping, health, 2x rideshare, 2 paychecks (-$4,250), mortgage/car/CC payments
- Seasonal: Dec (holiday shopping, travel), Feb (travel), May (Memorial Day)

6 net worth snapshots: Dec 2025 (-$264,200) → May 2026 (-$249,580) — ~$2,400/mo improvement arc

Also seeded: 3 goals, 7 budgets, 3 sinking funds ($600/mo total: Emergency $300, Car $150, Vacation $150), dashboard config (9 widgets), user profile ($8,500 income, $6,500 expenses → $908 surplus)

Script output:
```
✓ 10 accounts  (3 credit · 4 assets · 3 loans)
✓ 201 transactions across 6 months
✓ 6 net worth snapshots (Dec 2025 – May 2026)
✓ 3 goals · 7 budgets · 3 sinking funds ($600/mo total)
Credit card debt: $24,610, Net worth: -$253,832
```

**Decisions:**
- Auto-save (debounced 600ms) instead of a "Save Layout" button — cleaner UX; user sees changes immediately
- Touch sensor uses 200ms delay + 8px tolerance — tested threshold that reliably distinguishes swipe-to-scroll from drag intent
- Drag handle (`setActivatorNodeRef`) instead of full-card drag — keeps all interactive content (buttons, charts) clickable
- Demo data uses Dec 2025–May 2026 date range so "last 6 months" query windows populate correctly as of the current date
- `clearCollection()` at script start makes seed idempotent — safe to re-run

### v5.0 — Phase 1: Dashboard Overhaul

**What changed:**

**Design system lock-in:**
- Added `--font-mono` token to `:root` in `index.css` (Menlo/Consolas/Monaco fallback chain)
- Added `.widget-card`, `.widget-card-label`, `.widget-card-value` classes to `index.css` — standard card variant for dashboard widgets
- Confirmed compat alias tokens (`--text-sm`, `--yellow`, `--gray`, etc.) are not used in any TSX file — sweep is clean
- Updated `DESIGN.md` gaps section to reflect Phase 1 completion

**Net worth history (backend):**
- Added `recordNetWorthSnapshot(uid, accounts)` to `database.js` — computes `total_assets`, `total_liabilities`, `net_worth` from the accounts array, writes to `net_worth_history/{YYYY-MM}` with merge semantics (idempotent per month)
- Added `getNetWorthHistory(uid, limit=12)` to `database.js` — fetches ordered by doc ID (lexicographic = chronological for YYYY-MM), returns oldest-first for chart rendering
- `syncAllAccounts` in `plaidService.js` now calls `recordNetWorthSnapshot` after the sync loop completes, wrapped in try/catch so a snapshot failure never kills a sync
- Added `GET /api/net-worth-history` endpoint to `server.js`

**Dashboard manager (backend):**
- Added `getDashboardConfig(uid)` and `saveDashboardConfig(uid, widgets)` to `database.js` — reads/writes `dashboard_config/default` doc with `{ widgets: string[] }`; defaults to all 9 widgets if no doc exists
- Added `GET /api/dashboard-config` and `PUT /api/dashboard-config` endpoints to `server.js`

**Dashboard manager (frontend — `apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`):**
- Complete restructure: fixed-order bento grid → dynamic `activeWidgets.map(renderWidget)` with hero widget pinned first
- Added `WIDGET_CATALOG` (9 widgets: debt_projection, net_worth_trend, spending_by_category, goals_progress, interest_cost, savings_rate, priority_attack, ai_insights, alerts)
- `load()` now fetches 5 in parallel: dashboard data, goals, net worth history, spending summary, dashboard config
- `renderWidget(id)` switch renders each widget as the correct bento card class; conditionally returns null if required data isn't available (e.g., no history for net_worth_trend)
- Edit mode: "Edit" button in top-bar; ↑/↓ reorder buttons + checkbox toggles (upgraded to dnd-kit drag-and-drop in v5.1)
- Net worth trend widget: Recharts `LineChart` with `ReferenceLine` at y=0, shows `δ` vs first month
- Spending by category widget: top-5 categories with CSS progress bars (no extra chart)
- Fixed Goals link: `/goals` → `/plan?tab=goals`

**Decisions:**
- Hero widget (Total Debt) is not configurable — it's always shown. The 9-widget system covers secondary widgets.
- Edit mode initially used ↑/↓ buttons; upgraded to dnd-kit drag-and-drop in v5.1
- Dashboard config saves as `string[]` (not a map) — order is layout order, presence = active
- Net worth snapshot uses `set({ merge: true })` so it overwrites the same YYYY-MM doc on re-sync — last sync of the month wins

---

### v4.5 — Plaid Production Readiness

**What changed:**

**Backend — `server/services/plaidService.js`:**
- Added `createUpdateLinkToken(uid, accessToken)` — creates a Plaid Link token in update mode (passes `access_token` instead of `products`). Used to re-authenticate a broken bank connection without disconnecting it.
- Added `removeItem(accessToken)` — calls `client.itemRemove()` to revoke the Plaid access token on Plaid's side. Previously, deleting a bank only removed it from Firestore; the access token lived forever.
- Replaced `transactionsGet` (old date-range API) with cursor-based `transactionsSync`. Key differences: incremental (only fetches new/changed since last sync), handles `added` + `modified` + `removed` arrays, paginates automatically via `has_more`, stores `next_cursor` on the plaid_item doc so each sync is a delta not a full re-pull.
- `syncAllAccounts` now catches `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` / `ITEM_NOT_FOUND` per-item instead of failing the whole sync. Marks `error_status` on the item in Firestore and continues to the next item.

**Backend — `server/routes/plaid.js`:**
- Added `POST /api/plaid/create-link-token/update` — takes `item_id`, looks up the access token, returns an update-mode link token.
- Added `DELETE /api/plaid/items/:itemId` — disconnect an entire bank institution: calls `removeItem` on Plaid, deletes all accounts + transactions for that item, deletes the plaid_item doc.
- Fixed `DELETE /api/plaid/accounts/:id` — now calls `removeItem` on Plaid before deleting the plaid_item doc when removing the last account for an institution.
- `GET /api/plaid/items` now returns `error_status` field per item.

**Backend — `server/db/database.js`:**
- Added `deleteTransactions(uid, transactionIds)` — batch-deletes transactions by ID (used by cursor sync to handle Plaid's `removed` array).

**Frontend — `apps/web/src/pages/Settings.tsx`:**
- Added Connect Bank flow: loads Plaid Link script dynamically (`cdn.plaid.com/link/v2/stable/link-initialize.js`), calls create-link-token, opens Link widget, exchanges token, syncs immediately.
- Added Reconnect flow: for items with `error_status === 'ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED'`, shows a red warning banner and Reconnect button; opens Link in update mode; syncs on success to clear the error.
- Added Disconnect button per institution (with confirm prompt).
- Added Sync Now button (manual trigger for all connected banks).
- Updated `PlaidItem` interface to include `error_status`.
- Bumped displayed app version to 4.4.

### Competitive Analysis — Monarch vs Origin vs Zeroed

Researched feature parity with Monarch Money ($99/yr or $15/mo) and Origin ($99/yr or $13/mo).

**Where Zeroed is ahead:**
- Debt payoff engine depth (4 strategies + freed-minimum rollover + lump-sum simulator + required-payment calculator) — neither competitor goes this deep
- Card recommendation engine with TPG valuations — unique in the market
- Freed-minimum rollover specifically is sophisticated math neither Monarch nor Origin implements

**Critical gaps vs competitors:**

| Gap | Priority |
|-----|----------|
| Credit score monitoring (Monarch has Spinwheel/VantageScore) | High |
| Net worth history chart (both show trends; Zeroed only shows today's snapshot) | High |
| Manual account entry (can't add medical debt, personal loans without Plaid) | High |
| Cash flow forecasting 3–6 months | Medium |
| Investment tracking (Plaid pulls accounts but Zeroed shows nothing) | Medium |
| Budget AI recommendations (both competitors auto-suggest limits) | Medium |
| Couples/household mode (both have it) | Medium |
| Native iOS/Android (both have native apps; Zeroed is PWA) | High (pre-launch) |

**Ruled out:**
- Rewards/points balance data: Plaid doesn't have it. Yodlee does but costs $1–2K/month minimum, fully sales-led — not viable pre-revenue.
- Retirement modeling, tax filing, estate planning: that's Origin's premium positioning, not Zeroed's identity. Don't chase it.

**Business model decision:** Both Monarch and Origin are pure subscription, no free tier. Zeroed's freemium model (10 AI insights/month free) is a user acquisition differentiator — keep it but make the Pro gate meaningful.

**Plaid pricing update (as of April 15, 2026):** New "Trial plan" replaces old Limited Production. Auto-approved, free, up to 10 Production Items. No 2–3 week review anymore. Plaid prod is ready to flip when needed.

---

### Strategic Decisions Made

**Build order: UI first, then features.**

Reasoning: Consumer fintech lives on first impressions. A test user decides in 10 seconds whether this feels like a real product. Polish the Dashboard and lock in the design system before building new features — otherwise each new screen inherits inconsistencies. The Dashboard's net worth history chart is both a UI win and a feature gap, so these overlap.

**Phase 1 (now):** Dashboard overhaul + design system + dashboard manager
**Phase 2:** Credit score, manual accounts, net worth history, cash flow forecast, investment tracking
**Phase 3:** Budget AI, couples mode, lump-sum split, export
**Pre-go-live:** Plaid production credentials, Stripe gate, Plaid webhooks

**Dashboard manager concept:** Users can add, remove, and reorder up to 9 chart widgets on the Home screen. Planned widgets: debt projection, net worth trend, cash flow forecast, spending by category, credit score, goals progress, upcoming bills, interest cost over time, savings rate. Implementation will need a widget config stored per user in Firestore (array of widget IDs + order).

---

### Design System Reference (DESIGN.md)

Created `DESIGN.md` — the canonical reference for all UI work. Documents every CSS token, component class, responsive breakpoint, chart color, gradient, and anti-pattern from the actual `index.css` (not aspirational spec). Cross-linked from README.

**Why:** Without a reference artifact, every new screen risks drifting — hardcoded hex values, magic pixel numbers, one-off card divs. Now the rule is: read `DESIGN.md` first, use the tokens and classes, document any new patterns added.

**Current gaps identified:** no `--font-mono` token, compat alias tokens still used in some inline styles, no `.widget-card` for dashboard manager, no drag-and-drop CSS yet. These are Phase 1 items.

Also fixed: `index.html` title changed from "Vite + React + TS" → "Zeroed"; README Node prereq updated to v22.

---

### v4.4 — Cloud Functions 2nd Gen + Node 22

**Why:** Deploy warnings after v4.3 ship — Node 20 deprecated (EOL 2026-10-30) and firebase-functions SDK v4 flagged as outdated.

**What changed:**
- `server/package.json`: `engines.node` 20 → 22; `firebase-functions` `^4.0.0` → `^5.1.0`
- `server/index.js`: migrated from v1 API to v2 API:
  - `functions.https.onRequest(app)` → `onRequest(app)` from `firebase-functions/v2/https`
  - `functions.pubsub.schedule().timeZone().onRun()` → `onSchedule({ schedule, timeZone }, handler)` from `firebase-functions/v2/scheduler`
  - v2 handler no longer needs `return null`

**Deployment gotcha:** Firebase does not support upgrading 1st Gen → 2nd Gen in place. Had to delete the existing functions first (`firebase functions:delete api dailySync --region us-central1 --force`) before redeploying. Brief downtime (~2 min) during the transition.

**After deploy:** Functions log shows `creating Node.js 22 (2nd Gen)` — both warnings gone.

**Remaining non-issue:** Firebase CLI still prints "outdated firebase-functions" even on v5.1.1 — this is the CLI's own check lagging behind; deploy succeeds cleanly and can be ignored.

### v4.3 — Tech Debt Cleanup + 5-Tab Nav Consolidation

**Goal:** Before building more features, clean up naming inconsistencies and consolidate the 8+ page nav into a 5-tab structure suitable for web, iOS, and Android.

**Tech debt cleaned up:**

- **`expenses` → `sinking_funds`**: Firestore collection renamed. `database.js` functions renamed (`getExpenses` → `getSinkingFunds`, etc.). Field name standardized to `monthly_amount` throughout — previously Firestore stored as `amount` but all readers expected `monthly_amount`, causing `sinkingTotal` to always show $0.
- **`recommendations` → `rewards`**: `server/routes/recommendations.js` rewritten as `rewards.js`. API routes now `/api/rewards/categories` and `/api/rewards`. Frontend page `Recommend.tsx` renamed `Rewards.tsx` (deleted — now absorbed into Accounts).
- **`Activity.tsx` → `Spending.tsx`**: Page and function name aligned.
- **`/activity` → `/spending`**, **`/recommend` → `/rewards`**: Routes, nav components, and `packages/core/index.ts` ROUTES constants all updated.
- **Old vanilla HTML deleted**: `server/public/` (11 files from pre-React v3.1) removed — these were dead code serving nothing.
- **Duplicate routes eliminated**: `expenses.js` had both `/api/expenses` and `/api/expenses/sinking-funds` doing the same thing. Rewritten as clean single-route `sinking-funds.js`.

**Nav consolidation — 8 pages → 5 tabs with subtabs:**

Previous structure: Dashboard, Plan, Goals, Accounts, Budget, Spending, Rewards, Settings (8 standalone pages).

New structure:
| Tab | Subtabs |
|-----|---------|
| Home | — (Dashboard unchanged) |
| Plan | Strategy · Goals · AI Insights |
| Accounts | Accounts · Budget · Rewards |
| Spending | Transactions · Trends · Recurring |
| Settings | — |

**Built:**
- `Plan.tsx` rewritten — absorbs full `Goals.tsx` content as a subtab; adds AI Insights subtab (`GET /api/insights/latest`, `POST /api/insights/generate`)
- `Accounts.tsx` rewritten — absorbs `Budget.tsx` and `Rewards.tsx` content as subtabs
- `Spending.tsx` — adds "💳 Using the right card?" teaser card in Transactions tab with "Explore cards →" deep link to `/accounts?tab=rewards`
- `SubNav.tsx` — new reusable horizontal subtab bar component using existing `.pills`/`.pill` CSS classes
- `BottomNav.tsx` + `SideNav.tsx` — reduced from 7–8 items to 5 tabs
- `App.tsx` — removed standalone `/goals`, `/budget`, `/rewards` routes; added legacy redirects so old bookmarks still work (`/goals` → `/plan?tab=goals`, `/budget` → `/accounts?tab=budget`, `/rewards` → `/accounts?tab=rewards`)
- Deleted: `Goals.tsx`, `Budget.tsx`, `Rewards.tsx` (all content absorbed)

**Implementation decisions:**
- URL search params (`?tab=goals`) for subtab navigation, not component state — enables deep links like `/accounts?tab=rewards` that work on page load and are shareable
- `useSearchParams` from React Router v6 reads and writes subtab state; default tab maps to no param (clean URL)
- Lazy-load pattern for subtabs: each subtab only fetches data on first visit using `'idle'` state check — same pattern Spending already used for Trends/Recurring
- Rewards debounce timer uses `useRef` (not `useState`) — avoids re-render loops and TypeScript array-index errors
- Cross-tab flow (Spending → Rewards) uses a URL link not internal state — simpler and survives page refresh

**Bugs fixed during rewrite:**
- `sinkingTotal` always $0: Firestore stored field as `amount`, all readers expected `monthly_amount`. Fixed by standardizing storage to `monthly_amount`.
- Accounts.tsx: imported `useNavigate` and assigned `navigate` but never used it — removed.
- Accounts.tsx: `debounceRef` initially typed as `useState` instead of `useRef` — caused `[0]`/`[1]` index errors. Fixed to `useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null>(null)`.

## 2026-05-20

### v1.0 — Initial Build

**Built:**
- Express backend with Plaid API v29 integration (sandbox mode)
- SQLite database with `better-sqlite3`
- 5 screens: Dashboard, Plan, Accounts, Activity, Settings
- 4 payoff strategies: Avalanche, Snowball, Hybrid, Cash Flow with freed-minimum rollover
- Daily Plaid sync cron at 8am
- Dev seed data: 5 realistic credit card accounts, no Plaid credentials required
- Mobile-first PWA design, 480px max-width

**Decisions:**
- Single-user for now (user_id = 1 hardcoded) — multi-user deferred to Phase 2
- SQLite chosen for simplicity in early dev; migration to Supabase planned from day one
- Node.js stays (not Python) — backend language doesn't affect platform support, rewrite would cost weeks for zero user-facing benefit

---

### v1.1 — Payoff Strategies + Goals

**Built:**
- 4-strategy grid UI on Plan screen
- Lump-sum payment simulator (shows months saved + interest saved)
- Goals screen: debt-free date, per-card payoff, balance target goal types
- Required-payment calculator: binary search to find exact extra payment needed for any target date

---

### v1.2 — Sinking Funds

**Built:**
- Sinking funds manager in Settings — reserve monthly amounts for known future expenses
- Categories: car, home, medical, travel, education, holiday, tax, other
- Sinking fund total automatically subtracted from surplus in all calculations: dashboard, plan, lump-sum, required-payment
- Settings fixes: version number bump, category dropdown reset after adding, delete confirmation guard

**Why sinking funds matter:** Without them, the surplus is overstated and the payoff plan always slips. e.g. $1,200/yr car registration = $100/mo less available for debt.

---

### v1.3 — AI Spending Insights + Manual APR

**Built:**
- AI spending analysis card on Dashboard (not Plan — more visible there, where users land first)
- Sends 90-day transaction category breakdown + full debt profile to Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Returns exactly 3 numbered insights, cached in `user_insights` table
- Freemium gate: 10 free analyses/month tracked in `ai_usage` table; `is_pro` flag bypasses limit
- `GET /api/insights/latest` — returns cached insight + usage stats
- `POST /api/insights/generate` — checks limit, calls Claude, increments usage
- Manual APR inline edit on Accounts page — `PUT /api/plaid/accounts/:id/credit-details`
- Warning badge when APR or minimum payment is missing (Plaid sometimes omits these)

**Decisions:**
- AI costs accumulate to us (app owner via Anthropic API key); passed to users via freemium gate
- Stripe + auth deferred to Phase 2; manual Pro upgrade via SQL (`UPDATE users SET is_pro = true`) for now
- 10/month free tier — low enough to control costs, high enough to be useful for active users
- Insight kept on Dashboard so users see it without navigating to Plan

---

### v1.4 — Card Recommendation Engine *(pulled from second machine)*

**Built:**
- `cardProfiles.js` — 10 curated card profiles with `nameKeywords`, `centsPerPoint`, per-category `multipliers`
- `recommendationEngine.js` — `effectiveRate = multiplier × centsPerPoint`; 50% debt penalty for cards with active balances
- `GET /api/recommendations?category=dining&amount=50` — ranked results
- `GET /api/recommendations/categories` — category list with icons and `profilesLastUpdated` date
- Reward screen: category picker + ranked card list

**Decisions:**
- Cards with active debt ranked lower (`DEBT_PENALTY_FACTOR = 0.5`) to discourage points chasing while in debt — the math never favors rewards over 20%+ APR interest
- TPG (The Points Guy) valuations used for `centsPerPoint`; update quarterly
- `PROFILES_LAST_UPDATED` exposed in the API so the UI can show freshness

---

### v2.0 — PostgreSQL/Supabase Migration + GitHub Org

**Built:**
- Full database migration from SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) to PostgreSQL (`pg`)
- New `src/db/schema.sql`: BIGSERIAL, TIMESTAMPTZ, NUMERIC, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING — Supabase-native
- `database.js` rewritten: `query(text, params)`, `queryOne(text, params)`, `withTransaction(fn)` helpers; all async
- All routes + `server.js` + `plaidService.js` converted from sync to async/await
- SQL params changed from `?`/`@name` to `$1,$2,...` throughout
- SSL configured: `rejectUnauthorized: false` when DATABASE_URL isn't localhost (Supabase requirement)
- `pg` aggregate functions return strings — added `parseFloat()` where needed (e.g. `SUM(amount)` in insights)
- `ROUND(SUM(amount), 2)` → `ROUND(SUM(amount)::numeric, 2)` for explicit PostgreSQL cast

**Infrastructure changes:**
- Project email created: `thezeroedapp@gmail.com` — use this for all service accounts (Supabase, Plaid, Anthropic, Stripe, GitHub)
- GitHub org created: `thezeroedapp-ai`
- Repo migrated from `venkatbade/Zeroed` → `https://github.com/thezeroedapp-ai/zeroed`
- Old personal remote revoked and replaced with org remote

**Decisions:**
- No SQLite fallback — all-in on Supabase; hybrid complexity not worth it
- Schema run manually in Supabase SQL Editor (not auto-applied at startup) — keeps startup simple and prevents accidental re-runs
- Still single-user (user_id = 1 hardcoded) — multi-user auth is Phase 2, needs Supabase Auth wired up first
- Separate project email keeps personal and product accounts cleanly separated for future team access

**What's next:**
1. Multi-user auth: Supabase Auth, JWT scoping, remove hardcoded user_id = 1

### v2.1 — Supabase Live + NUMERIC Fix

**Supabase connected and verified working.**

**Bug found and fixed:** pg returns all `NUMERIC` columns as JavaScript strings by default. This caused string concatenation instead of numeric addition everywhere (e.g. minimum payments were `"719" + "277"` = `"719277"` instead of `996`). Dashboard showed `$0` total debt and `-$719,274,129` surplus.

**Fix:** Added a global pg type parser in `database.js`:
```js
const { Pool, types } = require('pg');
types.setTypeParser(1700, parseFloat); // 1700 = pg OID for NUMERIC
```
This converts all NUMERIC fields to JS floats at the driver level — no per-query casting needed anywhere else.

**Infrastructure note:** Supabase direct connections use IPv6 by default. Standard home/office networks are IPv4. Use the **Session Pooler** connection string (not Direct) — works on IPv4 and is the right choice for a persistent Express server.

**Architecture:** GitHub = code only (`.env` gitignored). Supabase = live database connected at runtime via `DATABASE_URL`. New devs clone from GitHub, add `.env`, connect to shared Supabase.

## 2026-05-22 (continued)

### v4.2 — Monarch/Origin Feature Parity + Production Deploy

**Goal:** Close the gap with Monarch Money and Origin — add all account types, net worth, budgets, spending trends, and recurring subscription detection. Ship to production.

**Built:**

**All Plaid account types:**
- `plaidService.js` was collapsing all non-credit accounts to `depository`. Fixed to pass through native Plaid `type` and `subtype` (`investment`, `loan`, `mortgage`, `brokerage`).
- `Accounts.tsx` fully rewritten: grouped by type (Cash & Savings, Investments, Credit Cards, Loans), net worth strip at top, subtype label shown below account name, APR/min edit only shown for credit accounts.

**Net worth:**
- Dashboard route in `server.js` extended: computes `totalAssets` (depository + investment + brokerage), `totalLiabilities` (credit + loan + mortgage), `netWorth = totalAssets - totalLiabilities`. All three returned in dashboard response.
- Dashboard hero card shows Assets / Net Worth inline row below main stats.
- Bug fixed: `sinkingTotal` was summing `e.amount` but Firestore stores it as `e.monthly_amount` — caused wrong surplus. Fixed to `e.monthly_amount || 0`.

**Budget system:**
- `server/routes/budgets.js` (new): GET enriches budgets with current-month `spent`, `remaining`, `pct` by fetching transactions in parallel; POST creates; DELETE removes.
- `server/db/database.js`: `getBudgets`, `upsertBudget`, `deleteBudget` added; `budgets` added to `deleteUserData`.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Budget.tsx` (new): preset category dropdown, monthly limit input, progress bars with green/amber/red coloring at 80%/100%, overall summary strip.
- Route registered in `server.js`: `app.use('/api/budgets', budgetsRoutes)`.

**Spending screen (renamed from Activity):**
- `Activity.tsx` rewritten with 3 tabs: Transactions, Trends, Recurring.
- Transactions tab: account name lookup from `accountMap[tx.account_id]`, filter by expenses (`amount > 0`) or payments (`amount < 0`), amount color (green for credits/payments, red for charges).
- Trends tab: `GET /api/transactions/trends` returns 6-month data (top 7 categories). Recharts `BarChart` with `stackId="a"` stacked bars, 7-color palette. TypeScript fix: recharts Tooltip `formatter` `name` param is `NameType | undefined`, must use `String(name ?? '')`.
- Recurring tab: `GET /api/transactions/recurring` groups by normalized description, finds 2+ distinct months, returns `avgAmount`, `annualEstimate`, `lastDate`. Annual total shown in hero.
- Trends + recurring lazy-load (only fetch on first tab select).

**Navigation:**
- `BottomNav.tsx` rewritten: 7 items — Home, Accounts, Plan, Budget, Spending, Reward, Settings. Goals removed from bottom nav.
- `SideNav.tsx` rewritten: 8 items — Home, Accounts, Plan, Budget, Goals, Spending, Reward, Settings. Goals stays in side nav.
- `App.tsx`: Budget route added (`/budget`).

**Decisions:**
- Lazy loading trends/recurring avoids slow API calls on tab load — only pay the cost when the user actually navigates there
- Recurring detection is pure server logic — no ML, just group by normalized description and count distinct months
- Budget categories use Plaid's own category names (Food and Drink, Travel, etc.) so they match transaction data without any mapping

### Firebase Production Deploy

First-ever production deploy. Lessons learned:

1. **Blaze plan required** — Firebase Cloud Functions needs the Blaze pay-as-you-go plan. Project was on free Spark plan; upgraded via console before deploy.
2. **GCP IAM permissions** — First deploy failed: `Storage Object Viewer` permission missing on `gcf-sources-537812060594-us-central1` bucket for `537812060594-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`. Fixed via GCP Console → IAM → grant Storage Object Viewer.
3. **Broken function state** — Second deploy got "Precondition failed" because the function was stuck in a failed CREATE state. Fixed by deleting the function: `firebase functions:delete api --region us-central1 --force`, then redeploying.
4. **Firebase account** — Must deploy with `thezeroedapp@gmail.com`, not personal account. `firebase logout && firebase login` before deploying.

Deploy command: `npm run deploy` (`npm run build:web && firebase deploy`)

**Live:** https://zeroed-3331d.web.app

---

### Mac + Windows Simultaneous Development Setup

Problem: `.env.local` (Firebase client config) was gitignored by the `*.local` pattern, so Mac users had to manually recreate it after cloning.

Solution:
1. `apps/web/.gitignore` — added `!.env.local` exception so the file is committed to git. Firebase client config is public by design (it's not a secret — it's the same config you paste into `<script>` tags on public websites).
2. `vite.config.ts` — proxy target now supports `API_TARGET` env var override: `process.env.API_TARGET ?? 'http://localhost:3000'`.
3. `package.json` — added `dev:web:remote` script: `cross-env API_TARGET=https://zeroed-3331d.web.app npm run dev --workspace=apps/web`. Added `cross-env` devDependency for cross-platform env var setting.
4. `.env.example` — documents all required server env vars with comments. AirDrop `.env` from Windows to Mac for full-stack dev.

**Mac dev workflows:**
- Full-stack: AirDrop `.env` from Windows, then `npm run dev` + `npm run dev:web`
- UI-only: `npm run dev:web:remote` — no server needed, proxies to production Firebase

---

### v4.1 — Dark Premium UI Redesign + Bug Fixes

**Goal:** Differentiate from Monarch/Origin with a debt-engine-first experience. Dark + premium aesthetic, interactive dashboards, bento grid layout.

**Built:**
- `apps/web/src/index.css` — complete rewrite. Dark design system: `#07090f` background, `#0d1424` card surfaces, violet accent (`#7c3aed` / `#a78bfa`). Compatibility aliases preserved so inline `var(--text-sm)`, `var(--blue-light)` etc. still resolve. Frosted-glass sticky top-bar and bottom nav via `backdrop-filter: blur`. Gradient progress bars, tabular-nums on all currency values.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — bento grid layout. Mobile: single column. Tablet (768px+): 2-column CSS grid. Desktop (1024px+): 4-column grid with named span classes (`bento-hero`, `bento-stat`, `bento-chart`, `bento-focus`, `bento-ai`, `bento-goals`). Recharts `AreaChart` renders a projected debt payoff curve from `totalDebt` + `debtFreeMonths` (new field returned by `/api/dashboard`). Curve uses an exponential decay approximating the freed-minimum rollover effect.
- Added `recharts` dependency to `apps/web`.

**Bug fixes:**
- `Recommend.tsx`: `fetchResults()` was calling plain `fetch()` without the Firebase auth token — changed to `apiFetch()`. Cards were returning 401 for all recommendation requests.
- `Goals.tsx`: `id` typed as `number` but Firestore returns string document IDs — changed to `string` throughout.
- `server/routes/plan.js`: Plan route now transforms engine output (`order`, `totalMonths`, `perCardTimeline`) into the shape `Plan.tsx` expects (`cards`, `months`, `scenarios`, `sinkingFundTotal`). Engine and frontend were never aligned until this fix.

**Design decisions:**
- Violet accent (`#7c3aed`) instead of blue — every other finance app uses blue; this creates immediate visual differentiation
- Bento grid only on Dashboard (the landing screen users see most) — other pages stay as clean card stacks to keep complexity low
- Chart generates a projected curve on the frontend from `debtFreeMonths`; no extra API call needed. Accuracy is approximate (exponential decay) but visually communicates the debt payoff trajectory clearly
- All existing class names preserved in new CSS — no breaking changes to components that weren't redesigned

## 2026-05-22

### v4.0 — Firebase Migration (Railway + Supabase → Firebase)

**Why:** Railway JWT secret corruption caused persistent 401 errors that couldn't be reproduced locally. Root cause was Railway corrupting the `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` env var, invalidating all existing tokens. Migrated to Firebase to eliminate the Railway dependency and consolidate to a single platform.

**What changed:**

- `server/db/database.js` — full rewrite. Replaced `pg` Pool with Firebase Admin SDK + Firestore. All user data in subcollections under `users/{uid}/`. `plaid_account_id` string = Firestore document ID (eliminates numeric-to-plaid mapping).
- `server/middleware/auth.js` — replaced `jsonwebtoken` + `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` with `admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token)`.
- `server/index.js` — new Cloud Functions entry: `exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app)` + `exports.dailySync` scheduled function replaces node-cron in production.
- `server/server.js` — exports `app` for Cloud Functions; starts locally via `require.main === module` guard.
- All routes rewritten for Firestore: no SQL, no JOINs, subcollections, `req.user.uid` (string) throughout.
- `apps/web/src/lib/firebase.ts` — new Firebase client init.
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch` now attaches Firebase ID token (`auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`).
- `apps/web/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — `onAuthStateChanged` replaces Supabase listener.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Login.tsx` + `Signup.tsx` — Firebase Auth SDK calls.
- `firebase.json` + `.firebaserc` + `firestore.rules` + `firestore.indexes.json` — new deploy config.
- Removed: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `pg`, `jsonwebtoken`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_*` env vars.
- Added: `firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions`, `firebase` (client SDK).

**Firestore schema decisions:**
- No `credit_details` subcollection — APR, minimum_payment etc. merged directly into account document on Plaid sync.
- `payoff_plans/{id}` uses embedded `items: [...]` array instead of a separate `plan_items` table.
- Timestamp serialization: `toObj()` helper converts Firestore Timestamp objects to ISO strings before JSON responses.

**Local dev:**
- `npm run dev` → Express on :3000 (reads `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` from `.env`)
- `npm run dev:web` → Vite on :5173 (proxies `/api` to :3000)
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` = full service account JSON on one line; Cloud Functions auto-initialize in production without it.

**Deploy:** `npm run deploy` = `npm run build:web && firebase deploy`

---

## 2026-05-21

### v3.2 — Monorepo Restructure + Responsive Web

**Built:**
- Monorepo directory structure: `server/` (Express), `apps/web/` (React), `packages/core/` (shared)
- `packages/core/index.ts` — shared `fmt()`, `fmtD()`, `ROUTES` constants; importable by any app in the monorepo
- Root `package.json` converted to npm workspaces: `apps/*`, `packages/*`
- `apps/web/vite.config.ts` — path alias `@zeroed/core → packages/core/index.ts`
- `apps/web/tsconfig.app.json` — matching `paths` entry so TypeScript resolves the alias
- `apps/web/src/components/SideNav.tsx` — left sidebar nav for tablet/desktop; same routes as BottomNav
- `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx` — shell wrapper: renders SideNav + BottomNav + page content
- `App.tsx` updated: `ProtectedRoute` wraps children in `Layout`; individual pages no longer import BottomNav
- Responsive CSS breakpoints in `index.css`:
  - Mobile (< 768px): bottom tab bar, 480px centered column (unchanged)
  - Tablet (768–1023px): 68px icon-only sidebar, bottom nav hidden, content full-width up to 860px
  - Desktop (≥ 1024px): 220px labeled sidebar, content up to 1000px, 4-column metrics grid

**Architecture:**
```
zeroed/
├── server/          ← Express API (was src/)
├── apps/web/        ← React + Vite (was client/)
├── packages/core/   ← shared TS (fmt, fmtD, ROUTES)
├── package.json     ← npm workspaces root
└── .env             ← root-level, loaded by server at startup
```

**Dev commands:**
- `npm run dev` — Express on :3000
- `npm run dev:web` — Vite on :5174 (proxies /api to :3000)
- `npm run build:web` — production build to `apps/web/dist`

---

### v3.1 — React + Vite Frontend Migration

**Built:**
- `client/` directory: Vite 5 + React 18 + TypeScript scaffold
- `client/src/index.css` — full design system ported from `style.css` (CSS variables, all component classes, auth page styles)
- `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` — lazy Supabase client initialization via `/api/config`
- `client/src/lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch()` (attaches JWT Bearer token), `fmt()`, `fmtD()` helpers
- `client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — React Context: session state, loading flag, `signOut()`; wraps entire app
- `client/src/components/BottomNav.tsx` — `NavLink`-based nav with active state via React Router
- `client/src/App.tsx` — React Router v6; `ProtectedRoute` + `PublicRoute` wrappers; all 9 routes
- 9 page components: `Login`, `Signup`, `Dashboard`, `Accounts`, `Plan`, `Goals`, `Activity`, `Recommend`, `Settings`

**Architecture:**
- Dev: Vite on `localhost:5174` proxies `/api/*` to Express on `localhost:3000`
- Production: `npm run build` outputs to `client/dist`; Express serves it
- Auth: same Supabase JWT pattern, now managed by React Context instead of global `auth.js`
- CSS: global CSS classes (no CSS modules) — same class names as the old HTML, zero visual regression

**Decisions:**
- TypeScript chosen for type safety and autocomplete as complexity grows
- Global CSS retained (not CSS modules) to keep migration 1:1 and avoid renames across all classes
- `client/` subfolder keeps Express backend source (`src/`) cleanly separated

---

### v3.0 — Multi-user Auth (Supabase Auth + Google OAuth)

**Built:**
- `src/middleware/auth.js` — JWT verification using `jsonwebtoken` + `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`; looks up user by `auth_id`; auto-creates profile on first OAuth login
- `auth_id TEXT UNIQUE` column added to `public.users` via `ALTER TABLE` + SQL migration
- DB trigger `on_auth_user_created` — fires on every `auth.users` INSERT, auto-creates `public.users` profile row with name from metadata
- `GET /api/config` — public endpoint serving `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the frontend
- `app.use('/api', authenticate)` — all API routes now require a valid Supabase JWT
- `src/public/auth.js` — shared frontend helper: `getSupabase()`, `getSession()`, `requireAuth()`, `apiFetch()`, `signOut()`
- `login.html` + `signup.html` — email/password + Google OAuth; match existing mobile-first design
- All 7 pages: Supabase CDN + auth.js added to head; `fetch(` → `apiFetch(`; `requireAuth()` guard at top of init
- All routes: `user_id = 1` → `req.user.id`; account queries filter by `pi.user_id = $N`
- Dev seed removed from startup — real users create their own data via signup

**Decisions:**
- `auth_id TEXT` (not UUID FK) keeps schema simple, avoids cross-schema FK complexity with `auth.users`
- Profile creation in both trigger AND middleware fallback — handles OAuth timing edge cases
- Only `/api/config` and `/api/health` are public; everything else requires JWT
- New Supabase "Publishable key" UI: use Legacy anon tab for `eyJ...` format needed by `@supabase/supabase-js` v2

**What's next:**
- Enable Google OAuth in Supabase Auth settings + configure Google Cloud Console credentials
- Stripe freemium — Pro gate for unlimited AI; `is_pro` already in schema
- Plaid production credentials
