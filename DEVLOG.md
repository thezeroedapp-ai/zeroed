### v4.4 — Cloud Functions 2nd Gen + Node 22

**Why:** Deploy warnings after v4.3 ship — Node 20 deprecated (EOL 2026-10-30) and firebase-functions SDK v4 flagged as outdated.

**What changed:**
- `server/package.json`: `engines.node` 20 → 22; `firebase-functions` `^4.0.0` → `^5.1.0`
- `server/index.js`: migrated from v1 API to v2 API:
  - `functions.https.onRequest(app)` → `onRequest(app)` from `firebase-functions/v2/https`
  - `functions.pubsub.schedule().timeZone().onRun()` → `onSchedule({ schedule, timeZone }, handler)` from `firebase-functions/v2/scheduler`
  - v2 handler no longer needs `return null`

**Deployment gotcha:** Firebase does not support upgrading 1st Gen → 2nd Gen in place. Had to delete the existing functions first (`firebase functions:delete api dailySync --region us-central1 --force`) before redeploying. Brief downtime (~2 min) during the transition.

**After deploy:** Functions log shows `creating Node.js 22 (2nd Gen)` — both warnings gone.

**Remaining non-issue:** Firebase CLI still prints "outdated firebase-functions" even on v5.1.1 — this is the CLI's own check lagging behind; deploy succeeds cleanly and can be ignored.

### v4.3 — Tech Debt Cleanup + 5-Tab Nav Consolidation

**Goal:** Before building more features, clean up naming inconsistencies and consolidate the 8+ page nav into a 5-tab structure suitable for web, iOS, and Android.

**Tech debt cleaned up:**

- **`expenses` → `sinking_funds`**: Firestore collection renamed. `database.js` functions renamed (`getExpenses` → `getSinkingFunds`, etc.). Field name standardized to `monthly_amount` throughout — previously Firestore stored as `amount` but all readers expected `monthly_amount`, causing `sinkingTotal` to always show $0.
- **`recommendations` → `rewards`**: `server/routes/recommendations.js` rewritten as `rewards.js`. API routes now `/api/rewards/categories` and `/api/rewards`. Frontend page `Recommend.tsx` renamed `Rewards.tsx` (deleted — now absorbed into Accounts).
- **`Activity.tsx` → `Spending.tsx`**: Page and function name aligned.
- **`/activity` → `/spending`**, **`/recommend` → `/rewards`**: Routes, nav components, and `packages/core/index.ts` ROUTES constants all updated.
- **Old vanilla HTML deleted**: `server/public/` (11 files from pre-React v3.1) removed — these were dead code serving nothing.
- **Duplicate routes eliminated**: `expenses.js` had both `/api/expenses` and `/api/expenses/sinking-funds` doing the same thing. Rewritten as clean single-route `sinking-funds.js`.

**Nav consolidation — 8 pages → 5 tabs with subtabs:**

Previous structure: Dashboard, Plan, Goals, Accounts, Budget, Spending, Rewards, Settings (8 standalone pages).

New structure:
| Tab | Subtabs |
|-----|---------|
| Home | — (Dashboard unchanged) |
| Plan | Strategy · Goals · AI Insights |
| Accounts | Accounts · Budget · Rewards |
| Spending | Transactions · Trends · Recurring |
| Settings | — |

**Built:**
- `Plan.tsx` rewritten — absorbs full `Goals.tsx` content as a subtab; adds AI Insights subtab (`GET /api/insights/latest`, `POST /api/insights/generate`)
- `Accounts.tsx` rewritten — absorbs `Budget.tsx` and `Rewards.tsx` content as subtabs
- `Spending.tsx` — adds "💳 Using the right card?" teaser card in Transactions tab with "Explore cards →" deep link to `/accounts?tab=rewards`
- `SubNav.tsx` — new reusable horizontal subtab bar component using existing `.pills`/`.pill` CSS classes
- `BottomNav.tsx` + `SideNav.tsx` — reduced from 7–8 items to 5 tabs
- `App.tsx` — removed standalone `/goals`, `/budget`, `/rewards` routes; added legacy redirects so old bookmarks still work (`/goals` → `/plan?tab=goals`, `/budget` → `/accounts?tab=budget`, `/rewards` → `/accounts?tab=rewards`)
- Deleted: `Goals.tsx`, `Budget.tsx`, `Rewards.tsx` (all content absorbed)

**Implementation decisions:**
- URL search params (`?tab=goals`) for subtab navigation, not component state — enables deep links like `/accounts?tab=rewards` that work on page load and are shareable
- `useSearchParams` from React Router v6 reads and writes subtab state; default tab maps to no param (clean URL)
- Lazy-load pattern for subtabs: each subtab only fetches data on first visit using `'idle'` state check — same pattern Spending already used for Trends/Recurring
- Rewards debounce timer uses `useRef` (not `useState`) — avoids re-render loops and TypeScript array-index errors
- Cross-tab flow (Spending → Rewards) uses a URL link not internal state — simpler and survives page refresh

**Bugs fixed during rewrite:**
- `sinkingTotal` always $0: Firestore stored field as `amount`, all readers expected `monthly_amount`. Fixed by standardizing storage to `monthly_amount`.
- Accounts.tsx: imported `useNavigate` and assigned `navigate` but never used it — removed.
- Accounts.tsx: `debounceRef` initially typed as `useState` instead of `useRef` — caused `[0]`/`[1]` index errors. Fixed to `useRef<ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null>(null)`.

## 2026-05-20

### v1.0 — Initial Build

**Built:**
- Express backend with Plaid API v29 integration (sandbox mode)
- SQLite database with `better-sqlite3`
- 5 screens: Dashboard, Plan, Accounts, Activity, Settings
- 4 payoff strategies: Avalanche, Snowball, Hybrid, Cash Flow with freed-minimum rollover
- Daily Plaid sync cron at 8am
- Dev seed data: 5 realistic credit card accounts, no Plaid credentials required
- Mobile-first PWA design, 480px max-width

**Decisions:**
- Single-user for now (user_id = 1 hardcoded) — multi-user deferred to Phase 2
- SQLite chosen for simplicity in early dev; migration to Supabase planned from day one
- Node.js stays (not Python) — backend language doesn't affect platform support, rewrite would cost weeks for zero user-facing benefit

---

### v1.1 — Payoff Strategies + Goals

**Built:**
- 4-strategy grid UI on Plan screen
- Lump-sum payment simulator (shows months saved + interest saved)
- Goals screen: debt-free date, per-card payoff, balance target goal types
- Required-payment calculator: binary search to find exact extra payment needed for any target date

---

### v1.2 — Sinking Funds

**Built:**
- Sinking funds manager in Settings — reserve monthly amounts for known future expenses
- Categories: car, home, medical, travel, education, holiday, tax, other
- Sinking fund total automatically subtracted from surplus in all calculations: dashboard, plan, lump-sum, required-payment
- Settings fixes: version number bump, category dropdown reset after adding, delete confirmation guard

**Why sinking funds matter:** Without them, the surplus is overstated and the payoff plan always slips. e.g. $1,200/yr car registration = $100/mo less available for debt.

---

### v1.3 — AI Spending Insights + Manual APR

**Built:**
- AI spending analysis card on Dashboard (not Plan — more visible there, where users land first)
- Sends 90-day transaction category breakdown + full debt profile to Claude (`claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Returns exactly 3 numbered insights, cached in `user_insights` table
- Freemium gate: 10 free analyses/month tracked in `ai_usage` table; `is_pro` flag bypasses limit
- `GET /api/insights/latest` — returns cached insight + usage stats
- `POST /api/insights/generate` — checks limit, calls Claude, increments usage
- Manual APR inline edit on Accounts page — `PUT /api/plaid/accounts/:id/credit-details`
- Warning badge when APR or minimum payment is missing (Plaid sometimes omits these)

**Decisions:**
- AI costs accumulate to us (app owner via Anthropic API key); passed to users via freemium gate
- Stripe + auth deferred to Phase 2; manual Pro upgrade via SQL (`UPDATE users SET is_pro = true`) for now
- 10/month free tier — low enough to control costs, high enough to be useful for active users
- Insight kept on Dashboard so users see it without navigating to Plan

---

### v1.4 — Card Recommendation Engine *(pulled from second machine)*

**Built:**
- `cardProfiles.js` — 10 curated card profiles with `nameKeywords`, `centsPerPoint`, per-category `multipliers`
- `recommendationEngine.js` — `effectiveRate = multiplier × centsPerPoint`; 50% debt penalty for cards with active balances
- `GET /api/recommendations?category=dining&amount=50` — ranked results
- `GET /api/recommendations/categories` — category list with icons and `profilesLastUpdated` date
- Reward screen: category picker + ranked card list

**Decisions:**
- Cards with active debt ranked lower (`DEBT_PENALTY_FACTOR = 0.5`) to discourage points chasing while in debt — the math never favors rewards over 20%+ APR interest
- TPG (The Points Guy) valuations used for `centsPerPoint`; update quarterly
- `PROFILES_LAST_UPDATED` exposed in the API so the UI can show freshness

---

### v2.0 — PostgreSQL/Supabase Migration + GitHub Org

**Built:**
- Full database migration from SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) to PostgreSQL (`pg`)
- New `src/db/schema.sql`: BIGSERIAL, TIMESTAMPTZ, NUMERIC, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING — Supabase-native
- `database.js` rewritten: `query(text, params)`, `queryOne(text, params)`, `withTransaction(fn)` helpers; all async
- All routes + `server.js` + `plaidService.js` converted from sync to async/await
- SQL params changed from `?`/`@name` to `$1,$2,...` throughout
- SSL configured: `rejectUnauthorized: false` when DATABASE_URL isn't localhost (Supabase requirement)
- `pg` aggregate functions return strings — added `parseFloat()` where needed (e.g. `SUM(amount)` in insights)
- `ROUND(SUM(amount), 2)` → `ROUND(SUM(amount)::numeric, 2)` for explicit PostgreSQL cast

**Infrastructure changes:**
- Project email created: `thezeroedapp@gmail.com` — use this for all service accounts (Supabase, Plaid, Anthropic, Stripe, GitHub)
- GitHub org created: `thezeroedapp-ai`
- Repo migrated from `venkatbade/Zeroed` → `https://github.com/thezeroedapp-ai/zeroed`
- Old personal remote revoked and replaced with org remote

**Decisions:**
- No SQLite fallback — all-in on Supabase; hybrid complexity not worth it
- Schema run manually in Supabase SQL Editor (not auto-applied at startup) — keeps startup simple and prevents accidental re-runs
- Still single-user (user_id = 1 hardcoded) — multi-user auth is Phase 2, needs Supabase Auth wired up first
- Separate project email keeps personal and product accounts cleanly separated for future team access

**What's next:**
1. Multi-user auth: Supabase Auth, JWT scoping, remove hardcoded user_id = 1

### v2.1 — Supabase Live + NUMERIC Fix

**Supabase connected and verified working.**

**Bug found and fixed:** pg returns all `NUMERIC` columns as JavaScript strings by default. This caused string concatenation instead of numeric addition everywhere (e.g. minimum payments were `"719" + "277"` = `"719277"` instead of `996`). Dashboard showed `$0` total debt and `-$719,274,129` surplus.

**Fix:** Added a global pg type parser in `database.js`:
```js
const { Pool, types } = require('pg');
types.setTypeParser(1700, parseFloat); // 1700 = pg OID for NUMERIC
```
This converts all NUMERIC fields to JS floats at the driver level — no per-query casting needed anywhere else.

**Infrastructure note:** Supabase direct connections use IPv6 by default. Standard home/office networks are IPv4. Use the **Session Pooler** connection string (not Direct) — works on IPv4 and is the right choice for a persistent Express server.

**Architecture:** GitHub = code only (`.env` gitignored). Supabase = live database connected at runtime via `DATABASE_URL`. New devs clone from GitHub, add `.env`, connect to shared Supabase.

## 2026-05-22 (continued)

### v4.2 — Monarch/Origin Feature Parity + Production Deploy

**Goal:** Close the gap with Monarch Money and Origin — add all account types, net worth, budgets, spending trends, and recurring subscription detection. Ship to production.

**Built:**

**All Plaid account types:**
- `plaidService.js` was collapsing all non-credit accounts to `depository`. Fixed to pass through native Plaid `type` and `subtype` (`investment`, `loan`, `mortgage`, `brokerage`).
- `Accounts.tsx` fully rewritten: grouped by type (Cash & Savings, Investments, Credit Cards, Loans), net worth strip at top, subtype label shown below account name, APR/min edit only shown for credit accounts.

**Net worth:**
- Dashboard route in `server.js` extended: computes `totalAssets` (depository + investment + brokerage), `totalLiabilities` (credit + loan + mortgage), `netWorth = totalAssets - totalLiabilities`. All three returned in dashboard response.
- Dashboard hero card shows Assets / Net Worth inline row below main stats.
- Bug fixed: `sinkingTotal` was summing `e.amount` but Firestore stores it as `e.monthly_amount` — caused wrong surplus. Fixed to `e.monthly_amount || 0`.

**Budget system:**
- `server/routes/budgets.js` (new): GET enriches budgets with current-month `spent`, `remaining`, `pct` by fetching transactions in parallel; POST creates; DELETE removes.
- `server/db/database.js`: `getBudgets`, `upsertBudget`, `deleteBudget` added; `budgets` added to `deleteUserData`.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Budget.tsx` (new): preset category dropdown, monthly limit input, progress bars with green/amber/red coloring at 80%/100%, overall summary strip.
- Route registered in `server.js`: `app.use('/api/budgets', budgetsRoutes)`.

**Spending screen (renamed from Activity):**
- `Activity.tsx` rewritten with 3 tabs: Transactions, Trends, Recurring.
- Transactions tab: account name lookup from `accountMap[tx.account_id]`, filter by expenses (`amount > 0`) or payments (`amount < 0`), amount color (green for credits/payments, red for charges).
- Trends tab: `GET /api/transactions/trends` returns 6-month data (top 7 categories). Recharts `BarChart` with `stackId="a"` stacked bars, 7-color palette. TypeScript fix: recharts Tooltip `formatter` `name` param is `NameType | undefined`, must use `String(name ?? '')`.
- Recurring tab: `GET /api/transactions/recurring` groups by normalized description, finds 2+ distinct months, returns `avgAmount`, `annualEstimate`, `lastDate`. Annual total shown in hero.
- Trends + recurring lazy-load (only fetch on first tab select).

**Navigation:**
- `BottomNav.tsx` rewritten: 7 items — Home, Accounts, Plan, Budget, Spending, Reward, Settings. Goals removed from bottom nav.
- `SideNav.tsx` rewritten: 8 items — Home, Accounts, Plan, Budget, Goals, Spending, Reward, Settings. Goals stays in side nav.
- `App.tsx`: Budget route added (`/budget`).

**Decisions:**
- Lazy loading trends/recurring avoids slow API calls on tab load — only pay the cost when the user actually navigates there
- Recurring detection is pure server logic — no ML, just group by normalized description and count distinct months
- Budget categories use Plaid's own category names (Food and Drink, Travel, etc.) so they match transaction data without any mapping

### Firebase Production Deploy

First-ever production deploy. Lessons learned:

1. **Blaze plan required** — Firebase Cloud Functions needs the Blaze pay-as-you-go plan. Project was on free Spark plan; upgraded via console before deploy.
2. **GCP IAM permissions** — First deploy failed: `Storage Object Viewer` permission missing on `gcf-sources-537812060594-us-central1` bucket for `537812060594-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`. Fixed via GCP Console → IAM → grant Storage Object Viewer.
3. **Broken function state** — Second deploy got "Precondition failed" because the function was stuck in a failed CREATE state. Fixed by deleting the function: `firebase functions:delete api --region us-central1 --force`, then redeploying.
4. **Firebase account** — Must deploy with `thezeroedapp@gmail.com`, not personal account. `firebase logout && firebase login` before deploying.

Deploy command: `npm run deploy` (`npm run build:web && firebase deploy`)

**Live:** https://zeroed-3331d.web.app

---

### Mac + Windows Simultaneous Development Setup

Problem: `.env.local` (Firebase client config) was gitignored by the `*.local` pattern, so Mac users had to manually recreate it after cloning.

Solution:
1. `apps/web/.gitignore` — added `!.env.local` exception so the file is committed to git. Firebase client config is public by design (it's not a secret — it's the same config you paste into `<script>` tags on public websites).
2. `vite.config.ts` — proxy target now supports `API_TARGET` env var override: `process.env.API_TARGET ?? 'http://localhost:3000'`.
3. `package.json` — added `dev:web:remote` script: `cross-env API_TARGET=https://zeroed-3331d.web.app npm run dev --workspace=apps/web`. Added `cross-env` devDependency for cross-platform env var setting.
4. `.env.example` — documents all required server env vars with comments. AirDrop `.env` from Windows to Mac for full-stack dev.

**Mac dev workflows:**
- Full-stack: AirDrop `.env` from Windows, then `npm run dev` + `npm run dev:web`
- UI-only: `npm run dev:web:remote` — no server needed, proxies to production Firebase

---

### v4.1 — Dark Premium UI Redesign + Bug Fixes

**Goal:** Differentiate from Monarch/Origin with a debt-engine-first experience. Dark + premium aesthetic, interactive dashboards, bento grid layout.

**Built:**
- `apps/web/src/index.css` — complete rewrite. Dark design system: `#07090f` background, `#0d1424` card surfaces, violet accent (`#7c3aed` / `#a78bfa`). Compatibility aliases preserved so inline `var(--text-sm)`, `var(--blue-light)` etc. still resolve. Frosted-glass sticky top-bar and bottom nav via `backdrop-filter: blur`. Gradient progress bars, tabular-nums on all currency values.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — bento grid layout. Mobile: single column. Tablet (768px+): 2-column CSS grid. Desktop (1024px+): 4-column grid with named span classes (`bento-hero`, `bento-stat`, `bento-chart`, `bento-focus`, `bento-ai`, `bento-goals`). Recharts `AreaChart` renders a projected debt payoff curve from `totalDebt` + `debtFreeMonths` (new field returned by `/api/dashboard`). Curve uses an exponential decay approximating the freed-minimum rollover effect.
- Added `recharts` dependency to `apps/web`.

**Bug fixes:**
- `Recommend.tsx`: `fetchResults()` was calling plain `fetch()` without the Firebase auth token — changed to `apiFetch()`. Cards were returning 401 for all recommendation requests.
- `Goals.tsx`: `id` typed as `number` but Firestore returns string document IDs — changed to `string` throughout.
- `server/routes/plan.js`: Plan route now transforms engine output (`order`, `totalMonths`, `perCardTimeline`) into the shape `Plan.tsx` expects (`cards`, `months`, `scenarios`, `sinkingFundTotal`). Engine and frontend were never aligned until this fix.

**Design decisions:**
- Violet accent (`#7c3aed`) instead of blue — every other finance app uses blue; this creates immediate visual differentiation
- Bento grid only on Dashboard (the landing screen users see most) — other pages stay as clean card stacks to keep complexity low
- Chart generates a projected curve on the frontend from `debtFreeMonths`; no extra API call needed. Accuracy is approximate (exponential decay) but visually communicates the debt payoff trajectory clearly
- All existing class names preserved in new CSS — no breaking changes to components that weren't redesigned

## 2026-05-22

### v4.0 — Firebase Migration (Railway + Supabase → Firebase)

**Why:** Railway JWT secret corruption caused persistent 401 errors that couldn't be reproduced locally. Root cause was Railway corrupting the `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` env var, invalidating all existing tokens. Migrated to Firebase to eliminate the Railway dependency and consolidate to a single platform.

**What changed:**

- `server/db/database.js` — full rewrite. Replaced `pg` Pool with Firebase Admin SDK + Firestore. All user data in subcollections under `users/{uid}/`. `plaid_account_id` string = Firestore document ID (eliminates numeric-to-plaid mapping).
- `server/middleware/auth.js` — replaced `jsonwebtoken` + `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` with `admin.auth().verifyIdToken(token)`.
- `server/index.js` — new Cloud Functions entry: `exports.api = functions.https.onRequest(app)` + `exports.dailySync` scheduled function replaces node-cron in production.
- `server/server.js` — exports `app` for Cloud Functions; starts locally via `require.main === module` guard.
- All routes rewritten for Firestore: no SQL, no JOINs, subcollections, `req.user.uid` (string) throughout.
- `apps/web/src/lib/firebase.ts` — new Firebase client init.
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch` now attaches Firebase ID token (`auth.currentUser.getIdToken()`).
- `apps/web/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — `onAuthStateChanged` replaces Supabase listener.
- `apps/web/src/pages/Login.tsx` + `Signup.tsx` — Firebase Auth SDK calls.
- `firebase.json` + `.firebaserc` + `firestore.rules` + `firestore.indexes.json` — new deploy config.
- Removed: `@supabase/supabase-js`, `pg`, `jsonwebtoken`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_*` env vars.
- Added: `firebase-admin`, `firebase-functions`, `firebase` (client SDK).

**Firestore schema decisions:**
- No `credit_details` subcollection — APR, minimum_payment etc. merged directly into account document on Plaid sync.
- `payoff_plans/{id}` uses embedded `items: [...]` array instead of a separate `plan_items` table.
- Timestamp serialization: `toObj()` helper converts Firestore Timestamp objects to ISO strings before JSON responses.

**Local dev:**
- `npm run dev` → Express on :3000 (reads `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` from `.env`)
- `npm run dev:web` → Vite on :5173 (proxies `/api` to :3000)
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` = full service account JSON on one line; Cloud Functions auto-initialize in production without it.

**Deploy:** `npm run deploy` = `npm run build:web && firebase deploy`

---

## 2026-05-21

### v3.2 — Monorepo Restructure + Responsive Web

**Built:**
- Monorepo directory structure: `server/` (Express), `apps/web/` (React), `packages/core/` (shared)
- `packages/core/index.ts` — shared `fmt()`, `fmtD()`, `ROUTES` constants; importable by any app in the monorepo
- Root `package.json` converted to npm workspaces: `apps/*`, `packages/*`
- `apps/web/vite.config.ts` — path alias `@zeroed/core → packages/core/index.ts`
- `apps/web/tsconfig.app.json` — matching `paths` entry so TypeScript resolves the alias
- `apps/web/src/components/SideNav.tsx` — left sidebar nav for tablet/desktop; same routes as BottomNav
- `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx` — shell wrapper: renders SideNav + BottomNav + page content
- `App.tsx` updated: `ProtectedRoute` wraps children in `Layout`; individual pages no longer import BottomNav
- Responsive CSS breakpoints in `index.css`:
  - Mobile (< 768px): bottom tab bar, 480px centered column (unchanged)
  - Tablet (768–1023px): 68px icon-only sidebar, bottom nav hidden, content full-width up to 860px
  - Desktop (≥ 1024px): 220px labeled sidebar, content up to 1000px, 4-column metrics grid

**Architecture:**
```
zeroed/
├── server/          ← Express API (was src/)
├── apps/web/        ← React + Vite (was client/)
├── packages/core/   ← shared TS (fmt, fmtD, ROUTES)
├── package.json     ← npm workspaces root
└── .env             ← root-level, loaded by server at startup
```

**Dev commands:**
- `npm run dev` — Express on :3000
- `npm run dev:web` — Vite on :5174 (proxies /api to :3000)
- `npm run build:web` — production build to `apps/web/dist`

---

### v3.1 — React + Vite Frontend Migration

**Built:**
- `client/` directory: Vite 5 + React 18 + TypeScript scaffold
- `client/src/index.css` — full design system ported from `style.css` (CSS variables, all component classes, auth page styles)
- `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` — lazy Supabase client initialization via `/api/config`
- `client/src/lib/api.ts` — `apiFetch()` (attaches JWT Bearer token), `fmt()`, `fmtD()` helpers
- `client/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` — React Context: session state, loading flag, `signOut()`; wraps entire app
- `client/src/components/BottomNav.tsx` — `NavLink`-based nav with active state via React Router
- `client/src/App.tsx` — React Router v6; `ProtectedRoute` + `PublicRoute` wrappers; all 9 routes
- 9 page components: `Login`, `Signup`, `Dashboard`, `Accounts`, `Plan`, `Goals`, `Activity`, `Recommend`, `Settings`

**Architecture:**
- Dev: Vite on `localhost:5174` proxies `/api/*` to Express on `localhost:3000`
- Production: `npm run build` outputs to `client/dist`; Express serves it
- Auth: same Supabase JWT pattern, now managed by React Context instead of global `auth.js`
- CSS: global CSS classes (no CSS modules) — same class names as the old HTML, zero visual regression

**Decisions:**
- TypeScript chosen for type safety and autocomplete as complexity grows
- Global CSS retained (not CSS modules) to keep migration 1:1 and avoid renames across all classes
- `client/` subfolder keeps Express backend source (`src/`) cleanly separated

---

### v3.0 — Multi-user Auth (Supabase Auth + Google OAuth)

**Built:**
- `src/middleware/auth.js` — JWT verification using `jsonwebtoken` + `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`; looks up user by `auth_id`; auto-creates profile on first OAuth login
- `auth_id TEXT UNIQUE` column added to `public.users` via `ALTER TABLE` + SQL migration
- DB trigger `on_auth_user_created` — fires on every `auth.users` INSERT, auto-creates `public.users` profile row with name from metadata
- `GET /api/config` — public endpoint serving `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to the frontend
- `app.use('/api', authenticate)` — all API routes now require a valid Supabase JWT
- `src/public/auth.js` — shared frontend helper: `getSupabase()`, `getSession()`, `requireAuth()`, `apiFetch()`, `signOut()`
- `login.html` + `signup.html` — email/password + Google OAuth; match existing mobile-first design
- All 7 pages: Supabase CDN + auth.js added to head; `fetch(` → `apiFetch(`; `requireAuth()` guard at top of init
- All routes: `user_id = 1` → `req.user.id`; account queries filter by `pi.user_id = $N`
- Dev seed removed from startup — real users create their own data via signup

**Decisions:**
- `auth_id TEXT` (not UUID FK) keeps schema simple, avoids cross-schema FK complexity with `auth.users`
- Profile creation in both trigger AND middleware fallback — handles OAuth timing edge cases
- Only `/api/config` and `/api/health` are public; everything else requires JWT
- New Supabase "Publishable key" UI: use Legacy anon tab for `eyJ...` format needed by `@supabase/supabase-js` v2

**What's next:**
- Enable Google OAuth in Supabase Auth settings + configure Google Cloud Console credentials
- Stripe freemium — Pro gate for unlimited AI; `is_pro` already in schema
- Plaid production credentials
